Unfortunately, we are unable to provide a date when they will be authorized to offer short-term stays. It is up to public health authorities to decide on appropriate measures for reopening tourism.\nSépaq is pleased to be able to begin gradually restoring access to its territories. This way, you’ll be able to enjoy the great outdoors to the benefit of your physical and mental health. Sépaq has implemented exceptional measures to help you get back to nature in complete safety\nFor full details on the resumption of activities, visit [Sépaq website](https://www.sepaq.com/covid-19/) .\nThe [Corporation de l’industrie touristique du Québec (CITQ) ](https://citq.qc.ca/en/index.php) has suspended its annual certification fees up to an indeterminate date. In addition, since the announcement of the government measures, no notice of payment of annual fees is being sent to the operators. Consequently, no penalty will be imposed and no certificate will be cancelled.  For the operators who have already paid the annual fees for 2020, the validity period of the certificate will be extended to account for the closing period requested by the Government.\nOperators of tourist accommodation establishments can verify if they are eligible for one of the various measures the Government of Québec has taken to support businesses and workers.\nLastly, operators affected by the current crisis can check with their financial institution, municipality or service providers (e.g., Hydro-Québec) to see if they are eligible for some relief.\nThe Public Health Act (CQLR, chapter  S-2.2) provides for penal provisions for any person who refuses to obey an order of the Minister of Health and Social Services, the national public health director, a public health director or a person authorized to act on their behalf. Police officers have the authority to issue statements of offence under this Act.\nThe public authorities are working to establish specific criteria for choosing establishments. First, the public health authorities will directly contact the hoteliers called on to cooperate. This measure will evolve as the situation changes. Once the agreements are confirmed with the hoteliers concerned, the public health authorities will take charge of the protocols. For more information you can contact the Association Hôtellerie Québec, which is responsible for managing the list of hotel establishments.\nYou may communicate your offer of accommodations to [admin@hotelleriequebec.com](mailto:admin@hotelleriequebec.com).\nDepending on the date, you may keep your reservation for now. However, remember that you may have to cancel later if the situation does not allow authorities to reopen certain types of accommodation.\nConsult the policy of the collaborative accommodation platform in question. Most have agreed on support measures in relation to the current health crisis or provided for force majeure clauses.\nOn April 26, 2020, the Gouvernement du Québec adopted an order authorizing bio-food producers and processors to rent units to house their employees in accommodation establishments regulated by the _Act respecting tourist accommodation establishments_(CQLR, chapter E-14.2). Under the order, even workers coming from other regions can be provided accommodations. The goal is to meet the needs of agricultural producers and bio-food processors whose activities include the operation of agricultural businesses, including the construction and renovation of farm buildings, as well as food processing, beverage production, slaughtering, market garden and horticultural production, fishing, and commercial aquaculture.\nOwners of tourist accommodations that have not yet received authorization to reopen may enter into exclusive agreements with agricultural producers and bio-food processors. However, owners of these establishments are still prohibited from providing tourist accommodations (stays of 31 days or less) to any other guests.\nIf the rental is for 31 days or more, the establishment is not considered a tourist accommodation establishment subject to the regulation. Any contract concluded must therefore specify a rental start and end date and indicate that it cannot be renewed under any circumstances. The lease entered into must specify the purpose of the rental (e.g., by an agricultural producer or bio-food processor as temporary accommodations for their seasonal or temporary workers) and the particular context in which it is being entered into, i.e., the health crisis. Both parties must clearly state their intention not to be bound by a residential lease agreement. The contract must also comply with the municipal planning by-laws relating to uses passed under the _Act respecting land use planning and development_ (CQLR, chapter A-19.1) and be sent to the municipality, borough, or regional county municipality for municipal tax purposes.\nOf course owners can go back to offering short-term tourist accommodations once public health officials lift these restrictions. Owners will, however, have to ensure that are adhering to the terms of the contract signed.\nWe urge you to contact Régie du logement for advice on your rights and responsibilities for long-term residential leases ([1-800-683-2245](tel://+1-800-683-2245) or [rdl.gouv.qc.ca](https://www.rdl.gouv.qc.ca/en/contact-us) ).\nYou are permitted to rent your establishment for stays of 31 days or more on a temporary basis. You may also rent your establishment as a long-term residential dwelling.\nIf the rental is for 31 days or more, the establishment is not considered a tourist accommodation establishment subject to the regulation. To rent your establishment as temporary accommodations, any contract concluded must therefore clearly specify a rental start and end date and indicate that it cannot be renewed under any circumstances. The lease entered into must specify the purpose of the rental (e.g., waiting for new construction) and the particular context in which it is being entered into, i.e., the health crisis. Both parties must clearly state their intention not to be bound by a residential lease agreement. The contract must also comply with the municipal planning by-laws relating to uses passed under the _Act respecting land use planning and development_ (CQLR, chapter A-19.1) and be sent to the municipality, borough, or regional county municipality for municipal tax purposes.\nThis option should allow you to go back to offering short-term tourist accommodations once permitted by public health officials if your establishment is not one of those that have been authorized to open. Owners will, however, have to ensure that are adhering to the terms of the contract signed.\nTo take advantage of the option to offer your establishment as a long-term residential dwelling, i.e., as a main residence for a tenant, you will have to fill out the lease form from Régie du logement. We urge you to contact Régie du logement for advice on your rights and responsibilities for long-term residential leases ([1-800-683-2245](tel://+1-800-683-2245) or [rdl.gouv.qc.ca](https://www.rdl.gouv.qc.ca/en/contact-us) ).\nThis form is not recommended if you wish to go back to operating a tourist accommodation establishment in the short or medium term. As mentioned above, the contract between the parties must specify the purpose of the agreement and the context in which it is being entered into. It must also clearly state that the parties do not intend to be bound by a residential lease agreement.\nHowever, if you wish to rent your establishment to a tenant for long-term (residential) housing purposes, you must use the Régie du logement lease form. For more information, please contact Régie du logement directly ([1-800-683-2245](tel://+1-800-683-2245) or [rdl.gouv.qc.ca](https://www.rdl.gouv.qc.ca/en/contact-us) ).\nThere is no such model lease or contract. You or a professional you hire must draw up the document. The lease or contract must clearly indicate a start and end date and the fact that it cannot be renewed under any circumstances. It must also state the purpose of the rental (e.g., offering temporary accommodations to essential workers outside their region of primary residence, agricultural producers, waiting for new construction) and the particular context in which it is being entered into, i.e., the health crisis. Both parties must also clearly state their intention not to be bound by a residential lease agreement.\nThe _Consumer Protection Act_ is still in effect (CQLR, chapter P-40.1). However, the Gouvernement du Québec is asking business owners to be understanding, given the current situation. We suggest looking at your lease contract and going to the Office de la protection du consommateur website at [www.opc.gouv.qc.ca](http://www.opc.gouv.qc.ca) .\nSince June 1, 2020, vacation homes and principal residence establishments outside Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal (CCM) and Municipalité régionale de compté (MRC) de Joliette can welcome visitors. Note that all such apartments, cottages, and houses must be rented in their entirety to individuals from a single household.\nAll campgrounds and outfitters may also reopen.\nWhen accommodations are vacated, they must be left unoccupied for 24 hours after they are cleaned and sanitized, except for units with hard surface floors (no rugs or other similar coverings) for rental to groups of 4 or fewer. The 24-hour wait time applies without exception to all units for 5 people or more.\nGuidelines have been drawn up by CNESST (Commission des normes, de l’équité, de la santé et de la sécurité du travail) and INSP (Institut national de santé publique). You may consult them at [cnesst.gouv.qc.ca](https://www.cnesst.gouv.qc.ca/) . In addition, special guidelines for each sector will be sent to all tourist operators to assist them in adapting their facilities and procedures and ensuring a safe and secure environment for workers and visitors.\nFor example, there is a requirement to wait 24 hours after sanitizing a unit before renting it out again, except for units with hard surface floors (no rugs or other similar coverings) for rental to groups of 4 or fewer. That means that if a cottage can accommodate 5 or more, it is subject to the 24-hour requirement.\nIn addition, owners are advised not to provide housekeeping services while the premises are occupied, but to provide the necessary equipment and most popular sanitizers for visitors to do their own cleaning during their stay.\nCNESST has also prepared guidelines for industry employers to help them ensure the safety of workers and visitors.\nFor now, people are being asked to limit their travel between regions. However, if they must travel to another region, they are advised to go directly to their destination and limit contact with local residents.\nWhat’s more, only vacation homes are allowed to be rented.\nYes, if you travel directly to your destination. Stops for essential needs (gas, medication, emergency repairs, restrooms, etc.) are also allowed.\nYes. However, people 70 and over are at greater risk of complications due to COVID‑19\\. It is recommended that vulnerable individuals, including those 70 and over, take special care to avoid being contaminated. That includes keeping their interregional travel and contact with people who are not part of their households to a minimum.\nOwners must comply with the 24-hour wait period after they clean their units, except for units with hard surface floors (no rugs or other similar coverings) that are rented out to groups of 4 or fewer. That means that units that can accommodate groups of 5 or more must respect the 24-hour requirement.\nThis transition measure will be adjusted as the pandemic evolves.\nNo. Members of a single household (i.e., people living under the same roof and sharing the same place of residence) are allowed to do so. So members of two households residing in two different places cannot stay together in a cottage, even if they are members of the same family. Indoor gatherings are still prohibited, whether they are in a cottage or elsewhere.\nFor the time being, the Direction générale de la santé publique does not authorize such a couple to do so. An accommodation unit can only be rented to one household at a time, that is, to individuals living in the same place. Public health authorities are monitoring the epidemiological situation of COVID-19 and will determine at the proper time whether the rule can be relaxed.\nYes. The children in shared custody can accompany their parents.\nPeople who don’t live at the same address are allowed to take part in tourism activities together provided they comply with [social distancing requirements](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/general-information-about-coronavirus/?no_cache=1%2F#c53182) at all times as well as the [rules for public gatherings](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/gatherings-events-covid19/?no_cache=1), and provided the activity is on the Gouvernement du Québec’s list of authorized activities.\nNo. The entire apartment or house must be rented out, and only to a single household at a time.\nThese facilities usually have common areas like washrooms and dining rooms and, in youth hostels, dormitories. For the moment, Direction de la santé publique has concluded that such facilities cannot operate under approved health rules.\nIn these particular cases, there are penal provisions under the _Public Health Act_ (CQLR, chapter S-2.2). If public health rules are not upheld, the police may issue statements of offence based on the offenses reported.\nAll organizations benefiting from the Festivals and Tourism Events Financial Assistance Program during the summer/fall 2020–2021 period will receive their first instalment (80% of the total grant amount) whether their activities have continued or not.\nIf applicable, the second instalment of up to 20% of the financial assistance will be disbursed based on the expenses incurred at the time the event is cancelled, upon receipt of supporting documents. Any amount paid in excess of the total costs incurred (including event-related expenses incurred after the cancellation date) will be recovered as required. Note that the total amount of government assistance will also be taken into account.\nAs in previous years, the first payment, amounting to 80% of the financial assistance, will be disbursed after the agreement has been signed.\nTo take advantage of these relief measures, the promoter must have obtained financial assistance through the Festivals and Tourism Events Financial Assistance Program for a festival or an event to be held between May 1 and October 31, 2020. These ad hoc measures have been adopted due to the exceptional circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nEvents that were scheduled to take place in March and April 2020, but were cancelled due to COVID-19 will also benefit from these measures.\nThe second instalment of up to 20% of the financial assistance will be disbursed based on the expenses incurred at the time the event is cancelled, upon receipt of supporting documents. Any amount paid in excess of the total costs incurred (including event-related expenses incurred after the cancellation date) will be recovered as required. Note that the total amount of government assistance will also be taken into account.\nFinancial assistance applications are still being reviewed in spite of the pandemic. You should get a response within the next few weeks.\nGiven the exceptional circumstances, the requirements for financial assistance applications will be reviewed and communicated to proponents in due time.\nIn light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the Communications Department of Ministère du Tourisme is not calling for the negotiation of a new visibility agreement. If the festival or event is held, last year’s visibility agreement will apply. If financial assistance is being provided for the first time, the Communications Department will contact the festival or event promoter to reach a verbal visibility agreement.\nThe financial assistance granted applies only to costs incurred for the 2020 edition, whether the event is cancelled or not.\nPromoters will be able to submit new financial assistance applications for 2021 events this fall.\nAll organizations benefiting from Ministère du Tourisme’s Festivals and Tourism Events Financial Assistance Program during the 2020–2021 summer/fall period will receive their first instalment (80% of the total grant amount) whether their activities have continued or not, up to the actual costs incurred.\nIf applicable, the second instalment of up to 20% of the financial assistance will be disbursed based on the expenses incurred at the time the event is cancelled, upon receipt of supporting documents. Any amount paid in excess of the total costs incurred (including event-related expenses incurred after the cancellation date) will be recovered as required. Note that the total amount of government assistance will also be taken into account.\nIf you purchased tickets for an event that was cancelled as a result of a government order related to COVID-19, the merchant is normally required to reimburse you. The merchant may also offer a new date for the event. You are free to accept or decline this offer.\nAlso, you have the right to cancel ticket purchases made online, by phone or by mail, including through a reseller, if the event is no longer taking place.\nFor more information, visit the [Office de la protection du consommateur ](https://www.opc.gouv.qc.ca/) website.\n\nAll types of camper vehicles may be used in campgrounds, whether for a day or the whole season.\nYes, but only tent campers are allowed to use those washroom facilities still open.\nThe rules for washrooms will be adjusted over time.\nBefore washrooms may open, they must comply with the following measures:\n*   All campers must wash their hands before entering\n*   If possible, devices must be installed so that people can open doors with their feet\n*   Capacities must be determined and displayed for each room in each washroom facility based on 2-metre social distancing\n*   Washrooms must be cleaned and sanitized more frequently and adapted to meet all public health recommendations and requirements\nCampers in accommodation units, trailers, or RVs that have their own washrooms must use those facilities exclusively.\nThe standards in effect are the same as for Sépaq facilities, i.e.,\n*   Updated housekeeping standards for facilities and accommodation\n*   More frequent cleaning and sanitizing of common areas, washrooms, and high-contact surfaces\nNo, these facilities are not yet allowed to open. Unfortunately, we are unable to provide a date when they will be authorized to offer short-term stays. It is up to public health authorities to decide on appropriate measures for reopening tourism.\nSépaq is pleased to be able to begin gradually restoring access to its territories. This way, you’ll be able to enjoy the great outdoors to the benefit of your physical and mental health. Sépaq has implemented exceptional measures to help you get back to nature in complete safety\nFor full details on the resumption of activities, visit [Sépaq website](https://www.sepaq.com/covid-19/) .\nThe [Corporation de l’industrie touristique du Québec (CITQ) ](https://citq.qc.ca/en/index.php) has suspended its annual certification fees up to an indeterminate date. In addition, since the announcement of the government measures, no notice of payment of annual fees is being sent to the operators. Consequently, no penalty will be imposed and no certificate will be cancelled.  For the operators who have already paid the annual fees for 2020, the validity period of the certificate will be extended to account for the closing period requested by the Government.\nOperators of tourist accommodation establishments can verify if they are eligible for one of the various measures the Government of Québec has taken to support businesses and workers.\nLastly, operators affected by the current crisis can check with their financial institution, municipality or service providers (e.g., Hydro-Québec) to see if they are eligible for some relief.\nThe Public Health Act (CQLR, chapter  S-2.2) provides for penal provisions for any person who refuses to obey an order of the Minister of Health and Social Services, the national public health director, a public health director or a person authorized to act on their behalf. Police officers have the authority to issue statements of offence under this Act.\nThe public authorities are working to establish specific criteria for choosing establishments. First, the public health authorities will directly contact the hoteliers called on to cooperate. This measure will evolve as the situation changes. Once the agreements are confirmed with the hoteliers concerned, the public health authorities will take charge of the protocols. For more information you can contact the Association Hôtellerie Québec, which is responsible for managing the list of hotel establishments.\nYou may communicate your offer of accommodations to [admin@hotelleriequebec.com](mailto:admin@hotelleriequebec.com).\nDepending on the date, you may keep your reservation for now. However, remember that you may have to cancel later if the situation does not allow authorities to reopen certain types of accommodation.\nConsult the policy of the collaborative accommodation platform in question. Most have agreed on support measures in relation to the current health crisis or provided for force majeure clauses.\nOn April 26, 2020, the Gouvernement du Québec adopted an order authorizing bio-food producers and processors to rent units to house their employees in accommodation establishments regulated by the _Act respecting tourist accommodation establishments_(CQLR, chapter E-14.2). Under the order, even workers coming from other regions can be provided accommodations. The goal is to meet the needs of agricultural producers and bio-food processors whose activities include the operation of agricultural businesses, including the construction and renovation of farm buildings, as well as food processing, beverage production, slaughtering, market garden and horticultural production, fishing, and commercial aquaculture.\nOwners of tourist accommodations that have not yet received authorization to reopen may enter into exclusive agreements with agricultural producers and bio-food processors. However, owners of these establishments are still prohibited from providing tourist accommodations (stays of 31 days or less) to any other guests.\nIf the rental is for 31 days or more, the establishment is not considered a tourist accommodation establishment subject to the regulation. Any contract concluded must therefore specify a rental start and end date and indicate that it cannot be renewed under any circumstances. The lease entered into must specify the purpose of the rental (e.g., by an agricultural producer or bio-food processor as temporary accommodations for their seasonal or temporary workers) and the particular context in which it is being entered into, i.e., the health crisis. Both parties must clearly state their intention not to be bound by a residential lease agreement. The contract must also comply with the municipal planning by-laws relating to uses passed under the _Act respecting land use planning and development_ (CQLR, chapter A-19.1) and be sent to the municipality, borough, or regional county municipality for municipal tax purposes.\nOf course owners can go back to offering short-term tourist accommodations once public health officials lift these restrictions. Owners will, however, have to ensure that are adhering to the terms of the contract signed.\nWe urge you to contact Régie du logement for advice on your rights and responsibilities for long-term residential leases ([1-800-683-2245](tel://+1-800-683-2245) or [rdl.gouv.qc.ca](https://www.rdl.gouv.qc.ca/en/contact-us) ).\nYou are permitted to rent your establishment for stays of 31 days or more on a temporary basis. You may also rent your establishment as a long-term residential dwelling.\nIf the rental is for 31 days or more, the establishment is not considered a tourist accommodation establishment subject to the regulation.

You or a professional you hire must draw up the document. The lease or contract must clearly indicate a start and end date and the fact that it cannot be renewed under any circumstances. It must also state the purpose of the rental (e.g., offering temporary accommodations to essential workers outside their region of primary residence, agricultural producers, waiting for new construction) and the particular context in which it is being entered into, i.e., the health crisis.

Both parties must also clearly state their intention not to be bound by a residential lease agreement.\nThe _Consumer Protection Act_ is still in effect (CQLR, chapter P-40.1). However, the Gouvernement du Québec is asking business owners to be understanding, given the current situation. We suggest looking at your lease contract and going to the Office de la protection du consommateur website at [www.opc.gouv.qc.ca](http://www.opc.gouv.qc.ca) .\nSince June 1, 2020, vacation homes and principal residence establishments outside Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal (CCM) and Municipalité régionale de compté (MRC) de Joliette can welcome visitors. Note that all such apartments, cottages, and houses must be rented in their entirety to individuals from a single household.\nAll campgrounds and outfitters may also reopen.\nWhen accommodations are vacated, they must be left unoccupied for 24 hours after they are cleaned and sanitized, except for units with hard surface floors (no rugs or other similar coverings) for rental to groups of 4 or fewer. The 24-hour wait time applies without exception to all units for 5 people or more.\nGuidelines have been drawn up by CNESST (Commission des normes, de l’équité, de la santé et de la sécurité du travail) and INSP (Institut national de santé publique). You may consult them at [cnesst.gouv.qc.ca](https://www.cnesst.gouv.qc.ca/) . In addition, special guidelines for each sector will be sent to all tourist operators to assist them in adapting their facilities and procedures and ensuring a safe and secure environment for workers and visitors.\nFor example, there is a requirement to wait 24 hours after sanitizing a unit before renting it out again, except for units with hard surface floors (no rugs or other similar coverings) for rental to groups of 4 or fewer. That means that if a cottage can accommodate 5 or more, it is subject to the 24-hour requirement.\nIn addition, owners are advised not to provide housekeeping services while the premises are occupied, but to provide the necessary equipment and most popular sanitizers for visitors to do their own cleaning during their stay.\nCNESST has also prepared guidelines for industry employers to help them ensure the safety of workers and visitors.\nFor now, people are being asked to limit their travel between regions. However, if they must travel to another region, they are advised to go directly to their destination and limit contact with local residents.\nWhat’s more, only vacation homes are allowed to be rented.\nYes, if you travel directly to your destination. Stops for essential needs (gas, medication, emergency repairs, restrooms, etc.) are also allowed.\nYes. However, people 70 and over are at greater risk of complications due to COVID‑19\\. It is recommended that vulnerable individuals, including those 70 and over, take special care to avoid being contaminated. That includes keeping their interregional travel and contact with people who are not part of their households to a minimum.\nOwners must comply with the 24-hour wait period after they clean their units, except for units with hard surface floors (no rugs or other similar coverings) that are rented out to groups of 4 or fewer. That means that units that can accommodate groups of 5 or more must respect the 24-hour requirement.\nThis transition measure will be adjusted as the pandemic evolves.\nNo. Members of a single household (i.e., people living under the same roof and sharing the same place of residence) are allowed to do so. So members of two households residing in two different places cannot stay together in a cottage, even if they are members of the same family. Indoor gatherings are still prohibited, whether they are in a cottage or elsewhere.\nFor the time being, the Direction générale de la santé publique does not authorize such a couple to do so. An accommodation unit can only be rented to one household at a time, that is, to individuals living in the same place. Public health authorities are monitoring the epidemiological situation of COVID-19 and will determine at the proper time whether the rule can be relaxed.\nYes. The children in shared custody can accompany their parents.\nPeople who don’t live at the same address are allowed to take part in tourism activities together provided they comply with [social distancing requirements](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/general-information-about-coronavirus/?no_cache=1%2F#c53182) at all times as well as the [rules for public gatherings](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/gatherings-events-covid19/?no_cache=1), and provided the activity is on the Gouvernement du Québec’s list of authorized activities.\nNo. The entire apartment or house must be rented out, and only to a single household at a time.\nThese facilities usually have common areas like washrooms and dining rooms and, in youth hostels, dormitories. For the moment, Direction de la santé publique has concluded that such facilities cannot operate under approved health rules.\nIn these particular cases, there are penal provisions under the _Public Health Act_ (CQLR, chapter S-2.2). If public health rules are not upheld, the police may issue statements of offence based on the offenses reported.\nAll organizations benefiting from the Festivals and Tourism Events Financial Assistance Program during the summer/fall 2020–2021 period will receive their first instalment (80% of the total grant amount) whether their activities have continued or not.\nIf applicable, the second instalment of up to 20% of the financial assistance will be disbursed based on the expenses incurred at the time the event is cancelled, upon receipt of supporting documents. Any amount paid in excess of the total costs incurred (including event-related expenses incurred after the cancellation date) will be recovered as required. Note that the total amount of government assistance will also be taken into account.\nAs in previous years, the first payment, amounting to 80% of the financial assistance, will be disbursed after the agreement has been signed.\nTo take advantage of these relief measures, the promoter must have obtained financial assistance through the Festivals and Tourism Events Financial Assistance Program for a festival or an event to be held between May 1 and October 31, 2020. These ad hoc measures have been adopted due to the exceptional circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nEvents that were scheduled to take place in March and April 2020, but were cancelled due to COVID-19 will also benefit from these measures.\nThe second instalment of up to 20% of the financial assistance will be disbursed based on the expenses incurred at the time the event is cancelled, upon receipt of supporting documents. Any amount paid in excess of the total costs incurred (including event-related expenses incurred after the cancellation date) will be recovered as required. Note that the total amount of government assistance will also be taken into account.\nFinancial assistance applications are still being reviewed in spite of the pandemic. You should get a response within the next few weeks.\nGiven the exceptional circumstances, the requirements for financial assistance applications will be reviewed and communicated to proponents in due time.\nIn light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the Communications Department of Ministère du Tourisme is not calling for the negotiation of a new visibility agreement. If the festival or event is held, last year’s visibility agreement will apply. If financial assistance is being provided for the first time, the Communications Department will contact the festival or event promoter to reach a verbal visibility agreement.\nThe financial assistance granted applies only to costs incurred for the 2020 edition, whether the event is cancelled or not.\nPromoters will be able to submit new financial assistance applications for 2021 events this fall.\nAll organizations benefiting from Ministère du Tourisme’s Festivals and Tourism Events Financial Assistance Program during the 2020–2021 summer/fall period will receive their first instalment (80% of the total grant amount) whether their activities have continued or not, up to the actual costs incurred.\nIf applicable, the second instalment of up to 20% of the financial assistance will be disbursed based on the expenses incurred at the time the event is cancelled, upon receipt of supporting documents. Any amount paid in excess of the total costs incurred (including event-related expenses incurred after the cancellation date) will be recovered as required. Note that the total amount of government assistance will also be taken into account.\nIf you purchased tickets for an event that was cancelled as a result of a government order related to COVID-19, the merchant is normally required to reimburse you. The merchant may also offer a new date for the event. You are free to accept or decline this offer.\nAlso, you have the right to cancel ticket purchases made online, by phone or by mail, including through a reseller, if the event is no longer taking place.\nFor more information, visit the [Office de la protection du consommateur ](https://www.opc.gouv.qc.ca/) website.\n\nSépaq is pleased to be able to begin gradually restoring access to its territories.

In addition, since the announcement of the government measures, no notice of payment of annual fees is being sent to the operators. Consequently, no penalty will be imposed and no certificate will be cancelled.  For the operators who have already paid the annual fees for 2020, the validity period of the certificate will be extended to account for the closing period requested by the Government.\nOperators of tourist accommodation establishments can verify if they are eligible for one of the various measures the Government of Québec has taken to support businesses and workers.\nLastly, operators affected by the current crisis can check with their financial institution, municipality or service providers (e.g., Hydro-Québec) to see if they are eligible for some relief.\nThe Public Health Act (CQLR, chapter  S-2.2) provides for penal provisions for any person who refuses to obey an order of the Minister of Health and Social Services, the national public health director, a public health director or a person authorized to act on their behalf.

Most have agreed on support measures in relation to the current health crisis or provided for force majeure clauses.\nOn April 26, 2020, the Gouvernement du Québec adopted an order authorizing bio-food producers and processors to rent units to house their employees in accommodation establishments regulated by the _Act respecting tourist accommodation establishments_(CQLR, chapter E-14.2). Under the order, even workers coming from other regions can be provided accommodations. The goal is to meet the needs of agricultural producers and bio-food processors whose activities include the operation of agricultural businesses, including the construction and renovation of farm buildings, as well as food processing, beverage production, slaughtering, market garden and horticultural production, fishing, and commercial aquaculture.\nOwners of tourist accommodations that have not yet received authorization to reopen may enter into exclusive agreements with agricultural producers and bio-food processors. However, owners of these establishments are still prohibited from providing tourist accommodations (stays of 31 days or less) to any other guests.\nIf the rental is for 31 days or more, the establishment is not considered a tourist accommodation establishment subject to the regulation. Any contract concluded must therefore specify a rental start and end date and indicate that it cannot be renewed under any circumstances. The lease entered into must specify the purpose of the rental (e.g., by an agricultural producer or bio-food processor as temporary accommodations for their seasonal or temporary workers) and the particular context in which it is being entered into, i.e., the health crisis. Both parties must clearly state their intention not to be bound by a residential lease agreement. The contract must also comply with the municipal planning by-laws relating to uses passed under the _Act respecting land use planning and development_ (CQLR, chapter A-19.1) and be sent to the municipality, borough, or regional county municipality for municipal tax purposes.\nOf course owners can go back to offering short-term tourist accommodations once public health officials lift these restrictions.

It must also clearly state that the parties do not intend to be bound by a residential lease agreement.\nHowever, if you wish to rent your establishment to a tenant for long-term (residential) housing purposes, you must use the Régie du logement lease form. For more information, please contact Régie du logement directly ([1-800-683-2245](tel://+1-800-683-2245) or [rdl.gouv.qc.ca](https://www.rdl.gouv.qc.ca/en/contact-us) ).\nThere is no such model lease or contract. You or a professional you hire must draw up the document. The lease or contract must clearly indicate a start and end date and the fact that it cannot be renewed under any circumstances. It must also state the purpose of the rental (e.g., offering temporary accommodations to essential workers outside their region of primary residence, agricultural producers, waiting for new construction) and the particular context in which it is being entered into, i.e., the health crisis. Both parties must also clearly state their intention not to be bound by a residential lease agreement.\nThe _Consumer Protection Act_ is still in effect (CQLR, chapter P-40.1). However, the Gouvernement du Québec is asking business owners to be understanding, given the current situation. We suggest looking at your lease contract and going to the Office de la protection du consommateur website at [www.opc.gouv.qc.ca](http://www.opc.gouv.qc.ca) .\nSince June 1, 2020, vacation homes and principal residence establishments outside Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal (CCM) and Municipalité régionale de compté (MRC) de Joliette can welcome visitors. Note that all such apartments, cottages, and houses must be rented in their entirety to individuals from a single household.\nAll campgrounds and outfitters may also reopen.\nWhen accommodations are vacated, they must be left unoccupied for 24 hours after they are cleaned and sanitized, except for units with hard surface floors (no rugs or other similar coverings) for rental to groups of 4 or fewer. The 24-hour wait time applies without exception to all units for 5 people or more.\nGuidelines have been drawn up by CNESST (Commission des normes, de l’équité, de la santé et de la sécurité du travail) and INSP (Institut national de santé publique). You may consult them at [cnesst.gouv.qc.ca](https://www.cnesst.gouv.qc.ca/) . In addition, special guidelines for each sector will be sent to all tourist operators to assist them in adapting their facilities and procedures and ensuring a safe and secure environment for workers and visitors.\nFor example, there is a requirement to wait 24 hours after sanitizing a unit before renting it out again, except for units with hard surface floors (no rugs or other similar coverings) for rental to groups of 4 or fewer. That means that if a cottage can accommodate 5 or more, it is subject to the 24-hour requirement.\nIn addition, owners are advised not to provide housekeeping services while the premises are occupied, but to provide the necessary equipment and most popular sanitizers for visitors to do their own cleaning during their stay.\nCNESST has also prepared guidelines for industry employers to help them ensure the safety of workers and visitors.\nFor now, people are being asked to limit their travel between regions. However, if they must travel to another region, they are advised to go directly to their destination and limit contact with local residents.\nWhat’s more, only vacation homes are allowed to be rented.\nYes, if you travel directly to your destination. Stops for essential needs (gas, medication, emergency repairs, restrooms, etc.) are also allowed.\nYes. However, people 70 and over are at greater risk of complications due to COVID‑19\\. It is recommended that vulnerable individuals, including those 70 and over, take special care to avoid being contaminated. That includes keeping their interregional travel and contact with people who are not part of their households to a minimum.\nOwners must comply with the 24-hour wait period after they clean their units, except for units with hard surface floors (no rugs or other similar coverings) that are rented out to groups of 4 or fewer. That means that units that can accommodate groups of 5 or more must respect the 24-hour requirement.\nThis transition measure will be adjusted as the pandemic evolves.\nNo. Members of a single household (i.e., people living under the same roof and sharing the same place of residence) are allowed to do so. So members of two households residing in two different places cannot stay together in a cottage, even if they are members of the same family. Indoor gatherings are still prohibited, whether they are in a cottage or elsewhere.\nFor the time being, the Direction générale de la santé publique does not authorize such a couple to do so. An accommodation unit can only be rented to one household at a time, that is, to individuals living in the same place. Public health authorities are monitoring the epidemiological situation of COVID-19 and will determine at the proper time whether the rule can be relaxed.\nYes. The children in shared custody can accompany their parents.\nPeople who don’t live at the same address are allowed to take part in tourism activities together provided they comply with [social distancing requirements](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/general-information-about-coronavirus/?no_cache=1%2F#c53182) at all times as well as the [rules for public gatherings](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/gatherings-events-covid19/?no_cache=1), and provided the activity is on the Gouvernement du Québec’s list of authorized activities.\nNo. The entire apartment or house must be rented out, and only to a single household at a time.\nThese facilities usually have common areas like washrooms and dining rooms and, in youth hostels, dormitories. For the moment, Direction de la santé publique has concluded that such facilities cannot operate under approved health rules.\nIn these particular cases, there are penal provisions under the _Public Health Act_ (CQLR, chapter S-2.2). If public health rules are not upheld, the police may issue statements of offence based on the offenses reported.\nAll organizations benefiting from the Festivals and Tourism Events Financial Assistance Program during the summer/fall 2020–2021 period will receive their first instalment (80% of the total grant amount) whether their activities have continued or not.\nIf applicable, the second instalment of up to 20% of the financial assistance will be disbursed based on the expenses incurred at the time the event is cancelled, upon receipt of supporting documents. Any amount paid in excess of the total costs incurred (including event-related expenses incurred after the cancellation date) will be recovered as required. Note that the total amount of government assistance will also be taken into account.\nAs in previous years, the first payment, amounting to 80% of the financial assistance, will be disbursed after the agreement has been signed.\nTo take advantage of these relief measures, the promoter must have obtained financial assistance through the Festivals and Tourism Events Financial Assistance Program for a festival or an event to be held between May 1 and October 31, 2020. These ad hoc measures have been adopted due to the exceptional circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nEvents that were scheduled to take place in March and April 2020, but were cancelled due to COVID-19 will also benefit from these measures.\nThe second instalment of up to 20% of the financial assistance will be disbursed based on the expenses incurred at the time the event is cancelled, upon receipt of supporting documents. Any amount paid in excess of the total costs incurred (including event-related expenses incurred after the cancellation date) will be recovered as required. Note that the total amount of government assistance will also be taken into account.\nFinancial assistance applications are still being reviewed in spite of the pandemic. You should get a response within the next few weeks.\nGiven the exceptional circumstances, the requirements for financial assistance applications will be reviewed and communicated to proponents in due time.\nIn light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the Communications Department of Ministère du Tourisme is not calling for the negotiation of a new visibility agreement. If the festival or event is held, last year’s visibility agreement will apply. If financial assistance is being provided for the first time, the Communications Department will contact the festival or event promoter to reach a verbal visibility agreement.\nThe financial assistance granted applies only to costs incurred for the 2020 edition, whether the event is cancelled or not.\nPromoters will be able to submit new financial assistance applications for 2021 events this fall.\nAll organizations benefiting from Ministère du Tourisme’s Festivals and Tourism Events Financial Assistance Program during the 2020–2021 summer/fall period will receive their first instalment (80% of the total grant amount) whether their activities have continued or not, up to the actual costs incurred.\nIf applicable, the second instalment of up to 20% of the financial assistance will be disbursed based on the expenses incurred at the time the event is cancelled, upon receipt of supporting documents. Any amount paid in excess of the total costs incurred (including event-related expenses incurred after the cancellation date) will be recovered as required. Note that the total amount of government assistance will also be taken into account.\nIf you purchased tickets for an event that was cancelled as a result of a government order related to COVID-19, the merchant is normally required to reimburse you. The merchant may also offer a new date for the event. You are free to accept or decline this offer.\nAlso, you have the right to cancel ticket purchases made online, by phone or by mail, including through a reseller, if the event is no longer taking place.\nFor more information, visit the [Office de la protection du consommateur ](https://www.opc.gouv.qc.ca/) website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Public and private schools**\nPreschools and elementary schools are gradually resuming their activities in all regions of Québec, with the exception of schools located in the [Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal](https://cmm.qc.ca/a-propos/territoires-et-municipalites/)  (In French only) (Montréal metropolitan community, CMM), which will remain closed to students until the end of August. The exceptions made for the territory of the Montréal metropolitan community also apply for the territory of the regional county municipality of Joliette.\nSecondary schools will remain closed until the end of August, following recommendations by public health authorities. Students will consolidate their distance learning through increased pedagogical support.\nAdministrative centres will continue to carry out essential activities; they therefore remain open. However, until schools reopen in their regions, administrative staff members are asked to work remotely whenever possible.\n\nPreschools and elementary schools are gradually resuming their activities in all regions of Québec, with the exception of schools located in the [Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal](https://cmm.qc.ca/a-propos/territoires-et-municipalites/)  (In French only) (Montréal metropolitan community, CMM), which will remain closed to students until the end of August. The exceptions made for the territory of the Montréal metropolitan community also apply for the territory of the regional county municipality of Joliette. Some secondary schools will also reopen, specifically public schools that offer regional or supraregional schooling services as well as private schools specialized in special education for students with disabilities or severe behavioral issues. Schools in the Montréal metropolitan community will reopen on May 25, health conditions permitting.\nSecondary schools will remain closed until the end of August, following recommendations by public health authorities.\n\nAs of May 11, students in these sectors have been able to resume their training in various ways (online courses, distance education), except for students whose schools are located in the Montréal metropolitan community and the regional county municipality of Joliette. These centres will open on May 25. Activities will resume in all training sectors.\nStaff in these sectors will also return to work, either at a distance or in person, depending on the program, while complying with physical distancing rules. Providing training at a distance or working from home should be the preferred delivery method in the current context.\nIf students must be present in person for practical training or certain evaluations, there must never be more than 15 individuals in the same space and physical distancing rules will apply.\n\nSince May 11, learners in this sector have been able to resume their training in various ways (online courses, distance education), except for learners whose centres are located in the Montréal metropolitan community and the regional county municipality of Joliette. These centres will open on May 25.\nAs of May 11 (May 25 for the Montréal metropolitan community and the regional county municipality of Joliette), adult education centres will be open for evaluations only. However, if students must be present in person for certain evaluations, there must never be more than 15 individuals in the same space and physical distancing rules will apply.\n\nThe measures put in place in the French sector will also apply in the English sector.\n\nIn general, elementary schools tend to be smaller than secondary schools. Secondary school students are more independent and are in a better position to finish their school year through distance learning.\nTeachers will provide pedagogical support, and sites such as [ecoleouverte.ca](https://ecoleouverte.ca/en/) , and educational activities kits will continue to be made available to elementary students, particularly those whose parents choose not to send them back to school.\n\nParents are not obliged to send their children back to school. Parents may decide to send them back to school after May 11, but they must give the school administration one week’s notice to allow for the organization of school transportation and pedagogical supervision in the classrooms.\n\nSchool organization will be based on public health recommendations, which are constantly evolving and can vary from region to region.\nEach school will take measures to respect the physical distancing recommendation of maintaining at least 2 metres between students. Where possible while following this recommendation, each group can have a maximum of 15 students.\nA variety of means can be used for groups where more than 15 students wish to return to school, such as reforming different groups of students at the same grade level, with each group staying in the same classroom until the end of the school year while respecting the 2-metre rule between individuals, for example.\nVisitors will not be allowed to enter the school.\n\nThe premises will be subject to regular, appropriate maintenance to ensure their cleanliness. Efforts will be made to raise awareness about proper handwashing and respiratory hygiene.\nHygiene and sanitation measures are being implemented in schools, as per public health recommendations.\n\nEach school will take measures to ensure that students stay the recommended 2 metres apart.\nSchool teams must carefully plan student groups according to the space they have available. It is possible that a child might not return to their usual classroom, as the groups will have to be smaller than usual.\nSchool teams must be particularly careful to set up the necessary supervision so that students remain at least 2 metres apart and wash their hands regularly. It is essential that teachers and parents collaborate in explaining these rules to the children.\n\nThe application of public health rules is at the heart of this return to normal life. Incidentally, 15 is the maximum number of children allowed per group, but fewer than 15 will be accepted into a group if a classroom is too small for it to respect the 2-metre physical distancing rule. Children will be assigned to a group and to a teacher, and measures will be taken to ensure that large groups of children are never in contact or together at the same time, such as having staggered recess times, with small groups of children.\nSchool organization will certainly look different. However, since the beginning of the pandemic, emergency daycare services have been set up in more than 350 elementary schools all across Québec and have managed to adapt to the new measures.\nOn the strength of the experience acquired in this context, and in collaboration with the public health authorities in each region, the school teams will ensure the safety of children and staff with care and vigilance.\n\nEach school will take steps to enforce physical distancing rules, thereby making sure to reduce the risk level.\nDifferent methods can be used if a group of more than 15 students wishes to return to school, such as reforming different groups of students at the same grade level, with each group staying in the same classroom until the end of the school year while respecting the 2-metre rule, for example.\n\nSchools will have to limit travel within the school, minimize times when groups travel at the same time and use staggered schedules.\nThey will use one room for classes, lunch and daycare. They will take turns using the schoolyard. Students must wash their hands regularly and avoid physical contact with each other.\n\nElementary schools are given the flexibility to adjust their schedules. For example, students could arrive and leave at different times to avoid gatherings.\n\nNo, wearing a mask is not compulsory. However, the government has confirmed that face coverings may be provided to teachers who request them.\nMeasures will also be taken by each educational institution to comply with the physical distancing rule of maintaining 2 metres between students.\nStudents or staff members with symptoms of COVID-19 must not enter the school. Any person who receives a diagnosis of COVID-19 must comply with a 14-day isolation period.\n\nNo. Like the rest of the population, students who are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms must stay at home and contact a health care professional. A [Self-Care Guide](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/self-care-guide-covid-19/) with information on the necessary steps to take has been made available to Quebecers. More information on the health guidelines to follow, especially who to contact in order to get tested, is available on [Québec.ca](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/).\n\nParents are not obliged to send their children back to school. However, returning to school is not recommended before September 2020 for children who are vulnerable for health reasons (chronic disease, severe immunodeficiency, etc.). Pedagogical support will be provided to these students.\n\nParents do not have the obligation to send their children back to school. However, as a precautionary measure, the presence at school of a child whose parents have a health vulnerability (chronic disease, severe immunodeficiency, pregnancy or person aged 70 or over) should rather be privileged from September 2020. By then, parents could opt for distance learning, with the support of members of the school staff.\n\nSchool attendance will remain non-compulsory until the end of the school year. Pedagogical support will be provided by teachers to all of their students, including those who do not return to the classroom. Those students will be provided with schoolwork by their teachers, who will also carry out a weekly follow-up with them.\nSince student advancement to the next grade level is determined by teachers’ professional judgment, teachers will be able to use online schoolwork or evaluations to validate their judgments of certain learning content.\nIn addition, in order to continue fostering learning by preschool, elementary and secondary students, the Ministère will continue to offer educational activities on the [Open School ](https://www.ecoleouverte.ca/en/) and on Télé-Québec. website and on Télé-Québec.\n\nVulnerable students are strongly encouraged to return to the classroom as soon as possible to be able to benefit from optimal pedagogical support. School staff will contact the parents to reassure them and provide appropriate support during the return to the classroom.\nThe members of the school teams will increase the weekly personalized follow-up with their students, giving priority to the most vulnerable students and using—for students who are not in the classroom—a technological tool allowing direct contact (e.g. telephone, video call).\n\nBeing present on the school premises is not recommended for staff members who are vulnerable for health reasons (chronic disease, severe immunodeficiency, pregnancy or aged 70 or older). For health and safety reasons, these staff members are encouraged to delay their return to school until September 2020.\n\nAs soon as a case is confirmed, the child is isolated in a room and cannot return to school for a period of 14 days. Schools have received an emergency kit to be used when a case of COVID-19 is confirmed.\nThe public health authority in the region concerned will assess the situation and issue appropriate instructions.\n\nAnyone who presents [symptoms associated with COVID-19](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/general-information-about-coronavirus/#c46469) must immediately leave the school premises, call 1-877-644-4545 and follow the instructions they are given. Pedagogical support will be provided to students during their absence from school.\n\nYes, school transportation will resume as soon as schools reopen, and the routes will be established based on the needs. Strict measures determined by the public health authority must be respected, including a limit of one child per bench. Every second bench must remain empty. The driver must be provided with a protective zone. In the event it is not possible to create a protective zone, drivers may wear the protective equipment provided.\nIt is recommended that parents transport their child to school until the end of the school year if they are able to do so.\n\nParents must inform the school as to whether they want their child to use school transportation, and the school will organize transportation based on the needs.\nIt is recommended that parents transport their child to school until the end of the school year if they are able to do so.\n\nStarting on May 11, as preschools and elementary schools in some regions reopen, school daycare services will resume regular operations in every school. Any family with children enrolled at a school can register for that school’s daycare services, if needed, by following the standard local procedures.\nIn the Montréal metropolitan community, emergency daycare services will remain open until the end of the school year. The exceptions made for the territory of the Montréal metropolitan community also apply for the territory of the regional county municipality of Joliette.\nAs this is a return to normal activities, students must register directly at the school where they are enrolled.\n\nThe main objective of the return to the classroom and of the support for students remaining at home will be to reinforce the essential learning required to move up to the next grade level.\n\nNo, the school year will not be extended into summer.\n\nStudent advancement to the next grade level will be determined by the students’ evaluations carried out before schools closed on March 13. In addition, teachers are asked to determine the students’ results for the last report card based on their knowledge of the students’ acquired learning.\nNo matter the level, schools must plan for a review period at the beginning of the 2020-2021 school year.\n\nAt the moment, it is difficult to predict the needs for educational staff as the number of students that will be present in schools is not yet known. However, the limitations imposed by physical distancing, that is, maintaining 2 metres between individuals, and the exclusion of employees who are vulnerable for health reasons will create added pressure on the availability of elementary school teachers. If necessary, secondary school teachers on permanent contracts will be asked to step in, with the support of professionals and support staff in elementary schools. The order allowing for this redeployment of resources must come from a reassignment measure from the local union, if necessary.\n\nNo. The ministerial examinations will not be administered. Students were unable to acquire all the learning targeted by the programs of study because of the health crisis that caused educational services to be suspended for a considerable amount of time.\n\nThe government can, if the circumstances warrant it, cancel an examination and use the marks awarded by the school as a final grade. Due to the current exceptional circumstances, the ministerial examinations will be cancelled, and the school results will be taken into account in the awarding of diplomas. Students will move up to the next grade level based on the teachers’ professional judgment and the students’ previous results on the first two report cards.\n\nNon-essential activities like infrastructure sharing are temporarily interrupted in order to slow the spread of the virus, as a public health measure. Related activities such as room rentals as well as sports and cultural activities are also targeted by the closure.\n\nA massive open [online course](https://jenseigneadistance.teluq.ca/)  (In French only) is available, free of charge, for teachers who wish to improve their understanding of how technological tools can be used to provide support.\n\nCollege- and university-level teaching activities will continue at a distance for the Summer 2020 term, until September, except in the case of practical training that cannot be carried out remotely and that is necessary to enable students to continue their studies in order to graduate.\nResearch activities in colleges, in the Centres collégiaux de transfert de technologie and in universities may resume. Accordingly, research activities related to the health, science, agriculture, forestry and engineering sectors, as well as vital seasonal outdoor activities, the resumption of which is urgently awaited, may now begin. The resumption of activities in all other research sectors should also be considered if these sectors are directly related to the collective effort to relaunch the economy.\nMoreover, institutions of higher education may resume any activity they deem necessary and may authorize some of their employees to return to the workplace. Whenever possible, remote work must still be the preferred approach when resuming these activities.\nAll of the above is conditional upon compliance with the guidelines issued by the competent authorities, namely the Direction de santé publique, the CNESST and the IRSST.\n\nIf internship settings have confirmed the continuation of the internship, the students’ workplace respects the guidelines issued by the public health authority, and the students are able to complete the internship, for example, by working remotely, then internships are possible. However, students cannot be penalized for their inability to meet requirements.\n\nIt is up to each institution to establish learning and evaluation procedures it deems appropriate in order to ensure that students develop the competencies required to complete their program of study and to graduate. Students should not be penalized for their inability to complete their program through alternative means developed by their institution.\n\n**Compiling of a list of students and materials**\nStudents may collect their personal effects once they have been invited to do so by the administration of the institution and in compliance with the hygiene measures issued by the Direction de Santé publique.\n**Access to educational institutions**\nThis is an exceptional procedure that aims to meet the most urgent needs of students, teachers and professors. The Ministère will not establish specific categories; rather, it will call upon institutions to identify the persons concerned as well as the order of priority.\nExceptionally, and for this purpose only, each institution must establish an adapted procedure that ensures compliance with physical distancing guidelines, particularly by tightly controlling the number of people who can access the institution’s premises. Anyone accessing a building on the institution’s premises must wash their hands upon entering and leaving. Students must be supervised when moving about the premises in order to minimize any risks.\nThe administration must establish a precise schedule in order to control the number of people present at any given time and to ensure that necessary services are available to students and teachers with special needs. If necessary, the administration may contact its regional public health agency to obtain further information.\nThese guidelines must be followed at all times:\n*   Handwashing is mandatory when entering a building.\n*   Physical distancing must be maintained and there must be no contact between individuals.\n*   Students cannot be accompanied by another person.\n*   Anyone experiencing flu-like symptoms must be excluded from this operation.\n\nThe modifications to the different administrative procedures announced for educational institutions apply to both Québec and international students. It is recommended that any information that may be of interest on this page be consulted as it pertains to all students.\n\nInternational students will be entitled to the [Canada Emergency Response Benefit ](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/cerb-application.html) (CERB) if they meet the program eligibility criteria, particularly:\n*   Have declared an income of at least $5000, earned in Canada or outside the country, during the last fiscal year or during the 12 months prior to their application. Applicants must be Canadian residents.\n*   Have stopped working in relation to the COVID-19 crisis, without having left their employment voluntarily. Thus, they are not eligible if they stopped working before the crisis began.\n\nNo measure is currently planned for this specific purpose.\nThe repatriation of foreign nationals is usually the responsibility of their country of origin.\n\nNo measure is currently planned for this specific purpose.No measure is currently planned for this specific purpose.\n\nNo measure is currently planned for this specific purpose.\nHowever, the Ministère has encouraged educational institutions to offer special support and possibly implement measures to help international students who may find themselves in a precarious situation.\n\nInternational students will be able to leave Canada based on available flights or may choose to stay in Canada if they have yet to complete their studies, provided that their immigration documents are in order.\n\nInstitutions are encouraged to continue processing all applications so as to not delay the subsequent steps required for international students to begin their studies at the chosen institution.\nInternational students must have a valid Québec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ) and study permit when they begin their classes. To obtain these documents, students must have a proof of admission.\nNote that international students are not required to obtain a CAQ and a study permit prior to starting a program of study through distance education while they are not residing in Canada. However, they will need to obtain these documents before being authorized to enter the country to complete their program in person, as needed.\n\nInternational students can attend distance courses, just like Québec students.\n\nImmigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has not announced the automatic renewal of temporary residency permits. Students are asked to submit a request for renewal before the date on which their permit expires. If students meet this condition, they are granted “implied status,” meaning that their current temporary residency is maintained until a decision is made regarding their application. International students are requested not to go to border crossings in an attempt to renew their immigration documents. The most up-to-date information is usually published by the [federal government](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/coronavirus-covid19/visitors-foreign-workers-students.html) .\nThe Ministère de l’Immigration, de la Francisation et de l’Intégration (MIFI) is extending, until December 31, 2020, the minister’s consent for the duration of the stay in Québec of international students whose Québec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ) for studies expires as of April 30, 2020 and before December 31, 2020. This regulation applies to students whose CAQ had not already expired on April 30, 2020.\nTemporary residents must maintain valid temporary resident status at all times. The Ministère de l’Immigration, de la Francisation et de l’intégration (MIFI) continues to process applications for temporary selection.\n\nStudents who were already studying in Canada and whose courses were moved online due to the travel restrictions and public health measures introduced because of COVID-19 will not be penalized and will retain their eligibility for the PGWPP, including the length of the work permit to which they would be entitled. However, these students must continue at least 50 % of their program of study in Canada to be eligible for the PGWPP.\n\nThe IRCC has introduced a new temporary policy for students who currently hold a study permit or who were approved for a study permit for a program set to begin in May or June 2020, but who are unable to enter Canada due to the current travel restrictions. If courses of study are delivered online exceptionally because of COVID-19, the eligibility of these students for the Post-Graduation Work Permit Program (PGWPP) will not be affected. International students in this situation can begin their courses from outside Canada and complete up to 50% of their program from outside the country if they cannot travel to Canada earlier.\n\ninternational students are not required to obtain a Québec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ) and a study permit to study through distance education. However, they will need to obtain these documents before being authorized to enter the country to complete their program in person, as needed.\nIt is important to note that students whose study permits were issued no later than March 18, 2020, are exempt from the [travel restrictions in place in Canada ](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/coronavirus-covid19/visitors-foreign-workers-students.html) and are therefore allowed to enter the country. However, they must not be experiencing any symptoms prior to boarding their flight and must undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine period upon their arrival.\n\nFor information on health protection, foreign nationals can refer to the Questions and answers about our services during the pandemic page on the [Régie de l’assurance maladie du Québec website](https://www.ramq.gouv.qc.ca/en/regie/press-room/Pages/questions-answers-services-during-pandemic.aspx) , specifically the following sections:\n*   COVID-19: Information and screening – What coverage does Québec provide for COVID-19 screening and care? \n*   Foreign workers and students in Québec: health insurance coverage\n\nThe Ministère de l’Immigration, de la Francisation et de l’Intégration (MIFI) is extending, until December 31, 2020, the minister’s consent for the duration of the stay in Québec of international students whose Québec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ) for studies expires as of April 30, 2020 and before December 31, 2020. This regulation applies to students whose CAQ had not already expired on April 30, 2020.\nThis decision is intended to facilitate the steps that must be taken by inernational students who were in the process of completing their study program but who must extend their stay in Québec due to the current health state of emergency and the temporary interruption of their courses.\nThese students can therefore submit an application to the federal government as soon as possible to have their study permit extended without having to include a new CAQ, which will allow them to maintain valid temporary residence status and to complete their study program when their courses resume.\n\nNo, international students will not have to pay any fees for extending their CAQ, since the required fees were already paid when they submitted their application for the CAQ that they obtained.\n\nInternational students who would like to extend their stay in Québec for studies beyond December 31, 2020, in order to complete a study program or to begin a new program in the fall 2020 semester, must submit a new application for a CAQ for studies to the MIFI and a new application for a study permit to the federal government. In all cases, students should start the required immigration procedures at least three months before their current authorization for studies expires.\n\nInternational students who have earned their degree can submit an application for permanent selection under the PEQ if they have been awarded, by an educational institution in Québec, within three years of the date of submission of their application, one of the following:\n*   a university diploma attesting to a bachelor’s, a master’s or a doctoral degree\n*   a college diploma for technical studies or a vocational diploma at the secondary level, with or without attestation of vocational specialization, obtained consecutively, attesting to 1800 hours or more of consecutive study and leading to a trade\nThe Ministère accepts attestations of successful completion of a study program as well as a final transcripts issued by the registrar of the educational institution. Since the programs admissible under the PEQ must have a minimum duration of 1800 hours, these graduates can obtain a three-year post-graduation work permit. The duration of this permit gives them all the time they need to submit an application for permanent selection under the PEQ as graduates or even as temporary foreign workers.\n\nThe federal government is responsible for issuing study permits. If you have any questions about study permits, please visit [Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada’s website](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/coronavirus-covid19/travel-restrictions-exemptions.html) .\n\nAll Explore 2020 spring and summer sessions have been cancelled.\n\nFinancial assistance will continue to be available for students whose period of studies may be lengthened.\n\nFor the moment, the student financial assistance program has not been modified. Payments will continue to be issued.\n\nThe income taken into account when calculating the 2019-2020 financial assistance is that of the 2019 calendar year. For that reason, any fluctuations in the students’ income in 2020 are not considered for 2019-2020. In some cases, they may, however, affect the calculations for 2020-2021. The government has announced that it will be postponing repayment of any loans incurred under the Loans and Bursaries Program and the Loans Program for Part-Time Studies for a period of six months.\n\nThe Loans and Bursaries Program already accounts for the financial needs of people who are caring for children. Students who have lost their jobs due to the current situation may apply for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.\n\nThe Minister of Education and Higher Education is currently studying the best ways to increase the amount of financial assistance awarded to students in Québec and is collaborating with the federal government to ensure financing. Announcements to student associations are planned in the coming weeks to prepare for a rollout in Fall 2020.\n\nNo, the government has announced that repayments of all loans contracted under the Loans and Bursaries Program and the Loans for Part-Time Studies Program are postponed for a period of six months. The government will pay the interest.\nNo payments are expected during this period. You do not have to take any steps or provide any proof to benefit from this exceptional measure, since it applies automatically to anyone who has incurred a debt with Aide financière aux études.\n\nNo. The government will pay the interest. Students are not required to make any payments during this period.\n\nYes. Contact your financial institution. They will tell you what steps to follow.\n\nNo. The government has made arrangements with all partner financial institutions to automatically postpone the repayment plan. People who have contracted student loans do not have to take any action.\n\nNo. Your financial institution will automatically extend the amortization period for your loan by six months and your monthly payments will remain the same.\n\nYes. This measure applies to all outstanding amounts, whether owed to a financial institution or in collection with Aide financière aux études.\n\nFor the next six months, you will not be required to make repayments of your student loan.\nYour Deferred Payment Plan is also suspended for six months.\nAfter this postponement ends, your Deferred Payment Plan will continue for the rest of the time remaining in it.\n\nNo. This postponement is not included in the 60 months of eligibility for the Deferred Payment Plan.\n\nNo. This postponement applies only to student loans contracted under a program offered by the Aide financière aux études department of the Ministère de l’Éducation et de l’Enseignement supérieur.\nIf you have questions about lines of credit and other student loans offered by your financial institution, please contact the staff there directly.\n\nOn this page:\n*   [Schools](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/answers-questions-coronavirus-covid19/translate-to-anglais-page-receptrice-theme-1/dossier-faq/faq-education/#c52318)\n*   [Higher education](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/answers-questions-coronavirus-covid19/translate-to-anglais-page-receptrice-theme-1/dossier-faq/faq-education/#c49949)\n*   [Aide financière aux études (Student financial assistance)](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/answers-questions-coronavirus-covid19/translate-to-anglais-page-receptrice-theme-1/dossier-faq/faq-education/#c52328)\n*   [Recreation and sports](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/answers-questions-coronavirus-covid19/translate-to-anglais-page-receptrice-theme-1/dossier-faq/faq-education/#c50707)\n*   [International students](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/answers-questions-coronavirus-covid19/translate-to-anglais-page-receptrice-theme-1/dossier-faq/faq-education/#c57563)\n**Public and private schools**\nPreschools and elementary schools are gradually resuming their activities in all regions of Québec, with the exception of schools located in the [Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal](https://cmm.qc.ca/a-propos/territoires-et-municipalites/)  (In French only) (Montréal metropolitan community, CMM), which will remain closed to students until the end of August. The exceptions made for the territory of the Montréal metropolitan community also apply for the territory of the regional county municipality of Joliette.\nSecondary schools will remain closed until the end of August, following recommendations by public health authorities. Students will consolidate their distance learning through increased pedagogical support.\nAdministrative centres will continue to carry out essential activities; they therefore remain open. However, until schools reopen in their regions, administrative staff members are asked to work remotely whenever possible.\nPreschools and elementary schools are gradually resuming their activities in all regions of Québec, with the exception of schools located in the [Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal](https://cmm.qc.ca/a-propos/territoires-et-municipalites/)  (In French only) (Montréal metropolitan community, CMM), which will remain closed to students until the end of August. The exceptions made for the territory of the Montréal metropolitan community also apply for the territory of the regional county municipality of Joliette. Some secondary schools will also reopen, specifically public schools that offer regional or supraregional schooling services as well as private schools specialized in special education for students with disabilities or severe behavioral issues. Schools in the Montréal metropolitan community will reopen on May 25, health conditions permitting.\nSecondary schools will remain closed until the end of August, following recommendations by public health authorities.\nAs of May 11, students in these sectors have been able to resume their training in various ways (online courses, distance education), except for students whose schools are located in the Montréal metropolitan community and the regional county municipality of Joliette. These centres will open on May 25. Activities will resume in all training sectors.\nStaff in these sectors will also return to work, either at a distance or in person, depending on the program, while complying with physical distancing rules. Providing training at a distance or working from home should be the preferred delivery method in the current context.\nIf students must be present in person for practical training or certain evaluations, there must never be more than 15 individuals in the same space and physical distancing rules will apply.\nSince May 11, learners in this sector have been able to resume their training in various ways (online courses, distance education), except for learners whose centres are located in the Montréal metropolitan community and the regional county municipality of Joliette. These centres will open on May 25.\nAs of May 11 (May 25 for the Montréal metropolitan community and the regional county municipality of Joliette), adult education centres will be open for evaluations only. However, if students must be present in person for certain evaluations, there must never be more than 15 individuals in the same space and physical distancing rules will apply.\nThe measures put in place in the French sector will also apply in the English sector.\nIn general, elementary schools tend to be smaller than secondary schools. Secondary school students are more independent and are in a better position to finish their school year through distance learning.\nTeachers will provide pedagogical support, and sites such as [ecoleouverte.ca](https://ecoleouverte.ca/en/) , and educational activities kits will continue to be made available to elementary students, particularly those whose parents choose not to send them back to school.\nParents are not obliged to send their children back to school. Parents may decide to send them back to school after May 11, but they must give the school administration one week’s notice to allow for the organization of school transportation and pedagogical supervision in the classrooms.\nSchool organization will be based on public health recommendations, which are constantly evolving and can vary from region to region.\nEach school will take measures to respect the physical distancing recommendation of maintaining at least 2 metres between students. Where possible while following this recommendation, each group can have a maximum of 15 students.\nA variety of means can be used for groups where more than 15 students wish to return to school, such as reforming different groups of students at the same grade level, with each group staying in the same classroom until the end of the school year while respecting the 2-metre rule between individuals, for example.\nVisitors will not be allowed to enter the school.\nThe premises will be subject to regular, appropriate maintenance to ensure their cleanliness. Efforts will be made to raise awareness about proper handwashing and respiratory hygiene.\nHygiene and sanitation measures are being implemented in schools, as per public health recommendations.\nEach school will take measures to ensure that students stay the recommended 2 metres apart.\nSchool teams must carefully plan student groups according to the space they have available. It is possible that a child might not return to their usual classroom, as the groups will have to be smaller than usual.\nSchool teams must be particularly careful to set up the necessary supervision so that students remain at least 2 metres apart and wash their hands regularly. It is essential that teachers and parents collaborate in explaining these rules to the children.\nThe application of public health rules is at the heart of this return to normal life. Incidentally, 15 is the maximum number of children allowed per group, but fewer than 15 will be accepted into a group if a classroom is too small for it to respect the 2-metre physical distancing rule. Children will be assigned to a group and to a teacher, and measures will be taken to ensure that large groups of children are never in contact or together at the same time, such as having staggered recess times, with small groups of children.\nSchool organization will certainly look different. However, since the beginning of the pandemic, emergency daycare services have been set up in more than 350 elementary schools all across Québec and have managed to adapt to the new measures.\nOn the strength of the experience acquired in this context, and in collaboration with the public health authorities in each region, the school teams will ensure the safety of children and staff with care and vigilance.\nEach school will take steps to enforce physical distancing rules, thereby making sure to reduce the risk level.\nDifferent methods can be used if a group of more than 15 students wishes to return to school, such as reforming different groups of students at the same grade level, with each group staying in the same classroom until the end of the school year while respecting the 2-metre rule, for example.\nSchools will have to limit travel within the school, minimize times when groups travel at the same time and use staggered schedules.\nThey will use one room for classes, lunch and daycare. They will take turns using the schoolyard. Students must wash their hands regularly and avoid physical contact with each other.\nElementary schools are given the flexibility to adjust their schedules. For example, students could arrive and leave at different times to avoid gatherings.\nNo, wearing a mask is not compulsory. However, the government has confirmed that face coverings may be provided to teachers who request them.\nMeasures will also be taken by each educational institution to comply with the physical distancing rule of maintaining 2 metres between students.\nStudents or staff members with symptoms of COVID-19 must not enter the school. Any person who receives a diagnosis of COVID-19 must comply with a 14-day isolation period.\nNo. Like the rest of the population, students who are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms must stay at home and contact a health care professional. A [Self-Care Guide](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/self-care-guide-covid-19/) with information on the necessary steps to take has been made available to Quebecers. More information on the health guidelines to follow, especially who to contact in order to get tested, is available on [Québec.ca](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/).\nParents are not obliged to send their children back to school. However, returning to school is not recommended before September 2020 for children who are vulnerable for health reasons (chronic disease, severe immunodeficiency, etc.). Pedagogical support will be provided to these students.\nParents do not have the obligation to send their children back to school. However, as a precautionary measure, the presence at school of a child whose parents have a health vulnerability (chronic disease, severe immunodeficiency, pregnancy or person aged 70 or over) should rather be privileged from September 2020. By then, parents could opt for distance learning, with the support of members of the school staff.\nSchool attendance will remain non-compulsory until the end of the school year. Pedagogical support will be provided by teachers to all of their students, including those who do not return to the classroom. Those students will be provided with schoolwork by their teachers, who will also carry out a weekly follow-up with them.\nSince student advancement to the next grade level is determined by teachers’ professional judgment, teachers will be able to use online schoolwork or evaluations to validate their judgments of certain learning content.\nIn addition, in order to continue fostering learning by preschool, elementary and secondary students, the Ministère will continue to offer educational activities on the [Open School ](https://www.ecoleouverte.ca/en/) and on Télé-Québec. website and on Télé-Québec.\nVulnerable students are strongly encouraged to return to the classroom as soon as possible to be able to benefit from optimal pedagogical support. School staff will contact the parents to reassure them and provide appropriate support during the return to the classroom.\nThe members of the school teams will increase the weekly personalized follow-up with their students, giving priority to the most vulnerable students and using—for students who are not in the classroom—a technological tool allowing direct contact (e.g. telephone, video call).\nBeing present on the school premises is not recommended for staff members who are vulnerable for health reasons (chronic disease, severe immunodeficiency, pregnancy or aged 70 or older). For health and safety reasons, these staff members are encouraged to delay their return to school until September 2020.\nAs soon as a case is confirmed, the child is isolated in a room and cannot return to school for a period of 14 days. Schools have received an emergency kit to be used when a case of COVID-19 is confirmed.\nThe public health authority in the region concerned will assess the situation and issue appropriate instructions.\nAnyone who presents [symptoms associated with COVID-19](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/general-information-about-coronavirus/#c46469) must immediately leave the school premises, call 1-877-644-4545 and follow the instructions they are given. Pedagogical support will be provided to students during their absence from school.\nYes, school transportation will resume as soon as schools reopen, and the routes will be established based on the needs. Strict measures determined by the public health authority must be respected, including a limit of one child per bench. Every second bench must remain empty. The driver must be provided with a protective zone. In the event it is not possible to create a protective zone, drivers may wear the protective equipment provided.\nIt is recommended that parents transport their child to school until the end of the school year if they are able to do so.\nParents must inform the school as to whether they want their child to use school transportation, and the school will organize transportation based on the needs.\nIt is recommended that parents transport their child to school until the end of the school year if they are able to do so.\nStarting on May 11, as preschools and elementary schools in some regions reopen, school daycare services will resume regular operations in every school. Any family with children enrolled at a school can register for that school’s daycare services, if needed, by following the standard local procedures.\nIn the Montréal metropolitan community, emergency daycare services will remain open until the end of the school year. The exceptions made for the territory of the Montréal metropolitan community also apply for the territory of the regional county municipality of Joliette.\nAs this is a return to normal activities, students must register directly at the school where they are enrolled.\nThe main objective of the return to the classroom and of the support for students remaining at home will be to reinforce the essential learning required to move up to the next grade level.\nNo, the school year will not be extended into summer.\nStudent advancement to the next grade level will be determined by the students’ evaluations carried out before schools closed on March 13. In addition, teachers are asked to determine the students’ results for the last report card based on their knowledge of the students’ acquired learning.\nNo matter the level, schools must plan for a review period at the beginning of the 2020-2021 school year.\nAt the moment, it is difficult to predict the needs for educational staff as the number of students that will be present in schools is not yet known. However, the limitations imposed by physical distancing, that is, maintaining 2 metres between individuals, and the exclusion of employees who are vulnerable for health reasons will create added pressure on the availability of elementary school teachers. If necessary, secondary school teachers on permanent contracts will be asked to step in, with the support of professionals and support staff in elementary schools. The order allowing for this redeployment of resources must come from a reassignment measure from the local union, if necessary.\nNo. The ministerial examinations will not be administered. Students were unable to acquire all the learning targeted by the programs of study because of the health crisis that caused educational services to be suspended for a considerable amount of time.\nThe government can, if the circumstances warrant it, cancel an examination and use the marks awarded by the school as a final grade. Due to the current exceptional circumstances, the ministerial examinations will be cancelled, and the school results will be taken into account in the awarding of diplomas. Students will move up to the next grade level based on the teachers’ professional judgment and the students’ previous results on the first two report cards.\nNon-essential activities like infrastructure sharing are temporarily interrupted in order to slow the spread of the virus, as a public health measure. Related activities such as room rentals as well as sports and cultural activities are also targeted by the closure.\nA massive open [online course](https://jenseigneadistance.teluq.ca/)  (In French only) is available, free of charge, for teachers who wish to improve their understanding of how technological tools can be used to provide support.\nCollege- and university-level teaching activities will continue at a distance for the Summer 2020 term, until September, except in the case of practical training that cannot be carried out remotely and that is necessary to enable students to continue their studies in order to graduate.\nResearch activities in colleges, in the Centres collégiaux de transfert de technologie and in universities may resume. Accordingly, research activities related to the health, science, agriculture, forestry and engineering sectors, as well as vital seasonal outdoor activities, the resumption of which is urgently awaited, may now begin. The resumption of activities in all other research sectors should also be considered if these sectors are directly related to the collective effort to relaunch the economy.\nMoreover, institutions of higher education may resume any activity they deem necessary and may authorize some of their employees to return to the workplace. Whenever possible, remote work must still be the preferred approach when resuming these activities.\nAll of the above is conditional upon compliance with the guidelines issued by the competent authorities, namely the Direction de santé publique, the CNESST and the IRSST.\nIf internship settings have confirmed the continuation of the internship, the students’ workplace respects the guidelines issued by the public health authority, and the students are able to complete the internship, for example, by working remotely, then internships are possible. However, students cannot be penalized for their inability to meet requirements.\nIt is up to each institution to establish learning and evaluation procedures it deems appropriate in order to ensure that students develop the competencies required to complete their program of study and to graduate. Students should not be penalized for their inability to complete their program through alternative means developed by their institution.\n**Compiling of a list of students and materials**\nStudents may collect their personal effects once they have been invited to do so by the administration of the institution and in compliance with the hygiene measures issued by the Direction de Santé publique.\n**Access to educational institutions**\nThis is an exceptional procedure that aims to meet the most urgent needs of students, teachers and professors. The Ministère will not establish specific categories; rather, it will call upon institutions to identify the persons concerned as well as the order of priority.\nExceptionally, and for this purpose only, each institution must establish an adapted procedure that ensures compliance with physical distancing guidelines, particularly by tightly controlling the number of people who can access the institution’s premises. Anyone accessing a building on the institution’s premises must wash their hands upon entering and leaving. Students must be supervised when moving about the premises in order to minimize any risks.\nThe administration must establish a precise schedule in order to control the number of people present at any given time and to ensure that necessary services are available to students and teachers with special needs. If necessary, the administration may contact its regional public health agency to obtain further information.\nThese guidelines must be followed at all times:\n*   Handwashing is mandatory when entering a building.\n*   Physical distancing must be maintained and there must be no contact between individuals.\n*   Students cannot be accompanied by another person.\n*   Anyone experiencing flu-like symptoms must be excluded from this operation.\nAll Explore 2020 spring and summer sessions have been cancelled.\nFinancial assistance will continue to be available for students whose period of studies may be lengthened.\nFor the moment, the student financial assistance program has not been modified. Payments will continue to be issued.\nThe income taken into account when calculating the 2019-2020 financial assistance is that of the 2019 calendar year. For that reason, any fluctuations in the students’ income in 2020 are not considered for 2019-2020. In some cases, they may, however, affect the calculations for 2020-2021. The government has announced that it will be postponing repayment of any loans incurred under the Loans and Bursaries Program and the Loans Program for Part-Time Studies for a period of six months.\nThe Loans and Bursaries Program already accounts for the financial needs of people who are caring for children. Students who have lost their jobs due to the current situation may apply for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.\nThe Minister of Education and Higher Education is currently studying the best ways to increase the amount of financial assistance awarded to students in Québec and is collaborating with the federal government to ensure financing. Announcements to student associations are planned in the coming weeks to prepare for a rollout in Fall 2020.\nNo, the government has announced that repayments of all loans contracted under the Loans and Bursaries Program and the Loans for Part-Time Studies Program are postponed for a period of six months. The government will pay the interest.\nNo payments are expected during this period. You do not have to take any steps or provide any proof to benefit from this exceptional measure, since it applies automatically to anyone who has incurred a debt with Aide financière aux études.\nNo. The government will pay the interest. Students are not required to make any payments during this period.\nYes. Contact your financial institution. They will tell you what steps to follow.\nNo. The government has made arrangements with all partner financial institutions to automatically postpone the repayment plan. People who have contracted student loans do not have to take any action.\nNo. Your financial institution will automatically extend the amortization period for your loan by six months and your monthly payments will remain the same.\nYes. This measure applies to all outstanding amounts, whether owed to a financial institution or in collection with Aide financière aux études.\nFor the next six months, you will not be required to make repayments of your student loan.\nYour Deferred Payment Plan is also suspended for six months.\nAfter this postponement ends, your Deferred Payment Plan will continue for the rest of the time remaining in it.\nNo. This postponement is not included in the 60 months of eligibility for the Deferred Payment Plan.\nNo. This postponement applies only to student loans contracted under a program offered by the Aide financière aux études department of the Ministère de l’Éducation et de l’Enseignement supérieur.\nIf you have questions about lines of credit and other student loans offered by your financial institution, please contact the staff there directly.\nThe modifications to the different administrative procedures announced for educational institutions apply to both Québec and international students. It is recommended that any information that may be of interest on this page be consulted as it pertains to all students.\nInternational students will be entitled to the [Canada Emergency Response Benefit ](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/cerb-application.html) (CERB) if they meet the program eligibility criteria, particularly:\n*   Have declared an income of at least $5000, earned in Canada or outside the country, during the last fiscal year or during the 12 months prior to their application. Applicants must be Canadian residents.\n*   Have stopped working in relation to the COVID-19 crisis, without having left their employment voluntarily. Thus, they are not eligible if they stopped working before the crisis began.\nNo measure is currently planned for this specific purpose.\nThe repatriation of foreign nationals is usually the responsibility of their country of origin.\nNo measure is currently planned for this specific purpose.No measure is currently planned for this specific purpose.\nNo measure is currently planned for this specific purpose.\nHowever, the Ministère has encouraged educational institutions to offer special support and possibly implement measures to help international students who may find themselves in a precarious situation.\nInternational students will be able to leave Canada based on available flights or may choose to stay in Canada if they have yet to complete their studies, provided that their immigration documents are in order.\nInstitutions are encouraged to continue processing all applications so as to not delay the subsequent steps required for international students to begin their studies at the chosen institution.\nInternational students must have a valid Québec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ) and study permit when they begin their classes. To obtain these documents, students must have a proof of admission.\nNote that international students are not required to obtain a CAQ and a study permit prior to starting a program of study through distance education while they are not residing in Canada. However, they will need to obtain these documents before being authorized to enter the country to complete their program in person, as needed.\nInternational students can attend distance courses, just like Québec students.\nImmigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has not announced the automatic renewal of temporary residency permits. Students are asked to submit a request for renewal before the date on which their permit expires. If students meet this condition, they are granted “implied status,” meaning that their current temporary residency is maintained until a decision is made regarding their application. International students are requested not to go to border crossings in an attempt to renew their immigration documents. The most up-to-date information is usually published by the [federal government](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/coronavirus-covid19/visitors-foreign-workers-students.html) .\nThe Ministère de l’Immigration, de la Francisation et de l’Intégration (MIFI) is extending, until December 31, 2020, the minister’s consent for the duration of the stay in Québec of international students whose Québec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ) for studies expires as of April 30, 2020 and before December 31, 2020. This regulation applies to students whose CAQ had not already expired on April 30, 2020.\nTemporary residents must maintain valid temporary resident status at all times. The Ministère de l’Immigration, de la Francisation et de l’intégration (MIFI) continues to process applications for temporary selection.\nStudents who were already studying in Canada and whose courses were moved online due to the travel restrictions and public health measures introduced because of COVID-19 will not be penalized and will retain their eligibility for the PGWPP, including the length of the work permit to which they would be entitled. However, these students must continue at least 50 % of their program of study in Canada to be eligible for the PGWPP.\nThe IRCC has introduced a new temporary policy for students who currently hold a study permit or who were approved for a study permit for a program set to begin in May or June 2020, but who are unable to enter Canada due to the current travel restrictions. If courses of study are delivered online exceptionally because of COVID-19, the eligibility of these students for the Post-Graduation Work Permit Program (PGWPP) will not be affected. International students in this situation can begin their courses from outside Canada and complete up to 50% of their program from outside the country if they cannot travel to Canada earlier.\ninternational students are not required to obtain a Québec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ) and a study permit to study through distance education. However, they will need to obtain these documents before being authorized to enter the country to complete their program in person, as needed.\nIt is important to note that students whose study permits were issued no later than March 18, 2020, are exempt from the [travel restrictions in place in Canada ](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/coronavirus-covid19/visitors-foreign-workers-students.html) and are therefore allowed to enter the country. However, they must not be experiencing any symptoms prior to boarding their flight and must undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine period upon their arrival.\nFor information on health protection, foreign nationals can refer to the Questions and answers about our services during the pandemic page on the [Régie de l’assurance maladie du Québec website](https://www.ramq.gouv.qc.ca/en/regie/press-room/Pages/questions-answers-services-during-pandemic.aspx) , specifically the following sections:\n*   COVID-19: Information and screening – What coverage does Québec provide for COVID-19 screening and care? \n*   Foreign workers and students in Québec: health insurance coverage\nThe Ministère de l’Immigration, de la Francisation et de l’Intégration (MIFI) is extending, until December 31, 2020, the minister’s consent for the duration of the stay in Québec of international students whose Québec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ) for studies expires as of April 30, 2020 and before December 31, 2020. This regulation applies to students whose CAQ had not already expired on April 30, 2020.\nThis decision is intended to facilitate the steps that must be taken by inernational students who were in the process of completing their study program but who must extend their stay in Québec due to the current health state of emergency and the temporary interruption of their courses.\nThese students can therefore submit an application to the federal government as soon as possible to have their study permit extended without having to include a new CAQ, which will allow them to maintain valid temporary residence status and to complete their study program when their courses resume.\nNo, international students will not have to pay any fees for extending their CAQ, since the required fees were already paid when they submitted their application for the CAQ that they obtained.\nInternational students who would like to extend their stay in Québec for studies beyond December 31, 2020, in order to complete a study program or to begin a new program in the fall 2020 semester, must submit a new application for a CAQ for studies to the MIFI and a new application for a study permit to the federal government. In all cases, students should start the required immigration procedures at least three months before their current authorization for studies expires.\nInternational students who have earned their degree can submit an application for permanent selection under the PEQ if they have been awarded, by an educational institution in Québec, within three years of the date of submission of their application, one of the following:\n*   a university diploma attesting to a bachelor’s, a master’s or a doctoral degree\n*   a college diploma for technical studies or a vocational diploma at the secondary level, with or without attestation of vocational specialization, obtained consecutively, attesting to 1800 hours or more of consecutive study and leading to a trade\nThe Ministère accepts attestations of successful completion of a study program as well as a final transcripts issued by the registrar of the educational institution. Since the programs admissible under the PEQ must have a minimum duration of 1800 hours, these graduates can obtain a three-year post-graduation work permit. The duration of this permit gives them all the time they need to submit an application for permanent selection under the PEQ as graduates or even as temporary foreign workers.\nThe federal government is responsible for issuing study permits.

The exceptions made for the territory of the Montréal metropolitan community also apply for the territory of the regional county municipality of Joliette.\nSecondary schools will remain closed until the end of August, following recommendations by public health authorities. Students will consolidate their distance learning through increased pedagogical support.\nAdministrative centres will continue to carry out essential activities; they therefore remain open. However, until schools reopen in their regions, administrative staff members are asked to work remotely whenever possible.\nPreschools and elementary schools are gradually resuming their activities in all regions of Québec, with the exception of schools located in the [Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal](https://cmm.qc.ca/a-propos/territoires-et-municipalites/)  (In French only) (Montréal metropolitan community, CMM), which will remain closed to students until the end of August. The exceptions made for the territory of the Montréal metropolitan community also apply for the territory of the regional county municipality of Joliette. Some secondary schools will also reopen, specifically public schools that offer regional or supraregional schooling services as well as private schools specialized in special education for students with disabilities or severe behavioral issues. Schools in the Montréal metropolitan community will reopen on May 25, health conditions permitting.\nSecondary schools will remain closed until the end of August, following recommendations by public health authorities.\nAs of May 11, students in these sectors have been able to resume their training in various ways (online courses, distance education), except for students whose schools are located in the Montréal metropolitan community and the regional county municipality of Joliette. These centres will open on May 25. Activities will resume in all training sectors.\nStaff in these sectors will also return to work, either at a distance or in person, depending on the program, while complying with physical distancing rules. Providing training at a distance or working from home should be the preferred delivery method in the current context.\nIf students must be present in person for practical training or certain evaluations, there must never be more than 15 individuals in the same space and physical distancing rules will apply.\nSince May 11, learners in this sector have been able to resume their training in various ways (online courses, distance education), except for learners whose centres are located in the Montréal metropolitan community and the regional county municipality of Joliette. These centres will open on May 25.\nAs of May 11 (May 25 for the Montréal metropolitan community and the regional county municipality of Joliette), adult education centres will be open for evaluations only. However, if students must be present in person for certain evaluations, there must never be more than 15 individuals in the same space and physical distancing rules will apply.\nThe measures put in place in the French sector will also apply in the English sector.\nIn general, elementary schools tend to be smaller than secondary schools. Secondary school students are more independent and are in a better position to finish their school year through distance learning.\nTeachers will provide pedagogical support, and sites such as [ecoleouverte.ca](https://ecoleouverte.ca/en/) , and educational activities kits will continue to be made available to elementary students, particularly those whose parents choose not to send them back to school.\nParents are not obliged to send their children back to school. Parents may decide to send them back to school after May 11, but they must give the school administration one week’s notice to allow for the organization of school transportation and pedagogical supervision in the classrooms.\nSchool organization will be based on public health recommendations, which are constantly evolving and can vary from region to region.\nEach school will take measures to respect the physical distancing recommendation of maintaining at least 2 metres between students. Where possible while following this recommendation, each group can have a maximum of 15 students.\nA variety of means can be used for groups where more than 15 students wish to return to school, such as reforming different groups of students at the same grade level, with each group staying in the same classroom until the end of the school year while respecting the 2-metre rule between individuals, for example.\nVisitors will not be allowed to enter the school.\nThe premises will be subject to regular, appropriate maintenance to ensure their cleanliness. Efforts will be made to raise awareness about proper handwashing and respiratory hygiene.\nHygiene and sanitation measures are being implemented in schools, as per public health recommendations.\nEach school will take measures to ensure that students stay the recommended 2 metres apart.\nSchool teams must carefully plan student groups according to the space they have available. It is possible that a child might not return to their usual classroom, as the groups will have to be smaller than usual.\nSchool teams must be particularly careful to set up the necessary supervision so that students remain at least 2 metres apart and wash their hands regularly. It is essential that teachers and parents collaborate in explaining these rules to the children.\nThe application of public health rules is at the heart of this return to normal life. Incidentally, 15 is the maximum number of children allowed per group, but fewer than 15 will be accepted into a group if a classroom is too small for it to respect the 2-metre physical distancing rule. Children will be assigned to a group and to a teacher, and measures will be taken to ensure that large groups of children are never in contact or together at the same time, such as having staggered recess times, with small groups of children.\nSchool organization will certainly look different. However, since the beginning of the pandemic, emergency daycare services have been set up in more than 350 elementary schools all across Québec and have managed to adapt to the new measures.\nOn the strength of the experience acquired in this context, and in collaboration with the public health authorities in each region, the school teams will ensure the safety of children and staff with care and vigilance.\nEach school will take steps to enforce physical distancing rules, thereby making sure to reduce the risk level.\nDifferent methods can be used if a group of more than 15 students wishes to return to school, such as reforming different groups of students at the same grade level, with each group staying in the same classroom until the end of the school year while respecting the 2-metre rule, for example.\nSchools will have to limit travel within the school, minimize times when groups travel at the same time and use staggered schedules.\nThey will use one room for classes, lunch and daycare. They will take turns using the schoolyard. Students must wash their hands regularly and avoid physical contact with each other.\nElementary schools are given the flexibility to adjust their schedules. For example, students could arrive and leave at different times to avoid gatherings.\nNo, wearing a mask is not compulsory. However, the government has confirmed that face coverings may be provided to teachers who request them.\nMeasures will also be taken by each educational institution to comply with the physical distancing rule of maintaining 2 metres between students.\nStudents or staff members with symptoms of COVID-19 must not enter the school. Any person who receives a diagnosis of COVID-19 must comply with a 14-day isolation period.\nNo. Like the rest of the population, students who are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms must stay at home and contact a health care professional. A [Self-Care Guide](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/self-care-guide-covid-19/) with information on the necessary steps to take has been made available to Quebecers. More information on the health guidelines to follow, especially who to contact in order to get tested, is available on [Québec.ca](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/).\nParents are not obliged to send their children back to school. However, returning to school is not recommended before September 2020 for children who are vulnerable for health reasons (chronic disease, severe immunodeficiency, etc.). Pedagogical support will be provided to these students.\nParents do not have the obligation to send their children back to school. However, as a precautionary measure, the presence at school of a child whose parents have a health vulnerability (chronic disease, severe immunodeficiency, pregnancy or person aged 70 or over) should rather be privileged from September 2020. By then, parents could opt for distance learning, with the support of members of the school staff.\nSchool attendance will remain non-compulsory until the end of the school year. Pedagogical support will be provided by teachers to all of their students, including those who do not return to the classroom. Those students will be provided with schoolwork by their teachers, who will also carry out a weekly follow-up with them.\nSince student advancement to the next grade level is determined by teachers’ professional judgment, teachers will be able to use online schoolwork or evaluations to validate their judgments of certain learning content.\nIn addition, in order to continue fostering learning by preschool, elementary and secondary students, the Ministère will continue to offer educational activities on the [Open School ](https://www.ecoleouverte.ca/en/) and on Télé-Québec. website and on Télé-Québec.\nVulnerable students are strongly encouraged to return to the classroom as soon as possible to be able to benefit from optimal pedagogical support. School staff will contact the parents to reassure them and provide appropriate support during the return to the classroom.\nThe members of the school teams will increase the weekly personalized follow-up with their students, giving priority to the most vulnerable students and using—for students who are not in the classroom—a technological tool allowing direct contact (e.g. telephone, video call).\nBeing present on the school premises is not recommended for staff members who are vulnerable for health reasons (chronic disease, severe immunodeficiency, pregnancy or aged 70 or older). For health and safety reasons, these staff members are encouraged to delay their return to school until September 2020.\nAs soon as a case is confirmed, the child is isolated in a room and cannot return to school for a period of 14 days. Schools have received an emergency kit to be used when a case of COVID-19 is confirmed.\nThe public health authority in the region concerned will assess the situation and issue appropriate instructions.\nAnyone who presents [symptoms associated with COVID-19](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/general-information-about-coronavirus/#c46469) must immediately leave the school premises, call 1-877-644-4545 and follow the instructions they are given. Pedagogical support will be provided to students during their absence from school.\nYes, school transportation will resume as soon as schools reopen, and the routes will be established based on the needs. Strict measures determined by the public health authority must be respected, including a limit of one child per bench. Every second bench must remain empty. The driver must be provided with a protective zone. In the event it is not possible to create a protective zone, drivers may wear the protective equipment provided.\nIt is recommended that parents transport their child to school until the end of the school year if they are able to do so.\nParents must inform the school as to whether they want their child to use school transportation, and the school will organize transportation based on the needs.\nIt is recommended that parents transport their child to school until the end of the school year if they are able to do so.\nStarting on May 11, as preschools and elementary schools in some regions reopen, school daycare services will resume regular operations in every school. Any family with children enrolled at a school can register for that school’s daycare services, if needed, by following the standard local procedures.\nIn the Montréal metropolitan community, emergency daycare services will remain open until the end of the school year. The exceptions made for the territory of the Montréal metropolitan community also apply for the territory of the regional county municipality of Joliette.\nAs this is a return to normal activities, students must register directly at the school where they are enrolled.\nThe main objective of the return to the classroom and of the support for students remaining at home will be to reinforce the essential learning required to move up to the next grade level.\nNo, the school year will not be extended into summer.\nStudent advancement to the next grade level will be determined by the students’ evaluations carried out before schools closed on March 13. In addition, teachers are asked to determine the students’ results for the last report card based on their knowledge of the students’ acquired learning.\nNo matter the level, schools must plan for a review period at the beginning of the 2020-2021 school year.\nAt the moment, it is difficult to predict the needs for educational staff as the number of students that will be present in schools is not yet known. However, the limitations imposed by physical distancing, that is, maintaining 2 metres between individuals, and the exclusion of employees who are vulnerable for health reasons will create added pressure on the availability of elementary school teachers. If necessary, secondary school teachers on permanent contracts will be asked to step in, with the support of professionals and support staff in elementary schools. The order allowing for this redeployment of resources must come from a reassignment measure from the local union, if necessary.\nNo. The ministerial examinations will not be administered. Students were unable to acquire all the learning targeted by the programs of study because of the health crisis that caused educational services to be suspended for a considerable amount of time.\nThe government can, if the circumstances warrant it, cancel an examination and use the marks awarded by the school as a final grade. Due to the current exceptional circumstances, the ministerial examinations will be cancelled, and the school results will be taken into account in the awarding of diplomas. Students will move up to the next grade level based on the teachers’ professional judgment and the students’ previous results on the first two report cards.\nNon-essential activities like infrastructure sharing are temporarily interrupted in order to slow the spread of the virus, as a public health measure. Related activities such as room rentals as well as sports and cultural activities are also targeted by the closure.\nA massive open [online course](https://jenseigneadistance.teluq.ca/)  (In French only) is available, free of charge, for teachers who wish to improve their understanding of how technological tools can be used to provide support.\nCollege- and university-level teaching activities will continue at a distance for the Summer 2020 term, until September, except in the case of practical training that cannot be carried out remotely and that is necessary to enable students to continue their studies in order to graduate.\nResearch activities in colleges, in the Centres collégiaux de transfert de technologie and in universities may resume. Accordingly, research activities related to the health, science, agriculture, forestry and engineering sectors, as well as vital seasonal outdoor activities, the resumption of which is urgently awaited, may now begin. The resumption of activities in all other research sectors should also be considered if these sectors are directly related to the collective effort to relaunch the economy.\nMoreover, institutions of higher education may resume any activity they deem necessary and may authorize some of their employees to return to the workplace. Whenever possible, remote work must still be the preferred approach when resuming these activities.\nAll of the above is conditional upon compliance with the guidelines issued by the competent authorities, namely the Direction de santé publique, the CNESST and the IRSST.\nIf internship settings have confirmed the continuation of the internship, the students’ workplace respects the guidelines issued by the public health authority, and the students are able to complete the internship, for example, by working remotely, then internships are possible. However, students cannot be penalized for their inability to meet requirements.\nIt is up to each institution to establish learning and evaluation procedures it deems appropriate in order to ensure that students develop the competencies required to complete their program of study and to graduate. Students should not be penalized for their inability to complete their program through alternative means developed by their institution.\n**Compiling of a list of students and materials**\nStudents may collect their personal effects once they have been invited to do so by the administration of the institution and in compliance with the hygiene measures issued by the Direction de Santé publique.\n**Access to educational institutions**\nThis is an exceptional procedure that aims to meet the most urgent needs of students, teachers and professors. The Ministère will not establish specific categories; rather, it will call upon institutions to identify the persons concerned as well as the order of priority.\nExceptionally, and for this purpose only, each institution must establish an adapted procedure that ensures compliance with physical distancing guidelines, particularly by tightly controlling the number of people who can access the institution’s premises. Anyone accessing a building on the institution’s premises must wash their hands upon entering and leaving. Students must be supervised when moving about the premises in order to minimize any risks.\nThe administration must establish a precise schedule in order to control the number of people present at any given time and to ensure that necessary services are available to students and teachers with special needs. If necessary, the administration may contact its regional public health agency to obtain further information.\nThese guidelines must be followed at all times:\n*   Handwashing is mandatory when entering a building.\n*   Physical distancing must be maintained and there must be no contact between individuals.\n*   Students cannot be accompanied by another person.\n*   Anyone experiencing flu-like symptoms must be excluded from this operation.\nAll Explore 2020 spring and summer sessions have been cancelled.\nFinancial assistance will continue to be available for students whose period of studies may be lengthened.\nFor the moment, the student financial assistance program has not been modified. Payments will continue to be issued.\nThe income taken into account when calculating the 2019-2020 financial assistance is that of the 2019 calendar year. For that reason, any fluctuations in the students’ income in 2020 are not considered for 2019-2020. In some cases, they may, however, affect the calculations for 2020-2021. The government has announced that it will be postponing repayment of any loans incurred under the Loans and Bursaries Program and the Loans Program for Part-Time Studies for a period of six months.\nThe Loans and Bursaries Program already accounts for the financial needs of people who are caring for children. Students who have lost their jobs due to the current situation may apply for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.\nThe Minister of Education and Higher Education is currently studying the best ways to increase the amount of financial assistance awarded to students in Québec and is collaborating with the federal government to ensure financing. Announcements to student associations are planned in the coming weeks to prepare for a rollout in Fall 2020.\nNo, the government has announced that repayments of all loans contracted under the Loans and Bursaries Program and the Loans for Part-Time Studies Program are postponed for a period of six months. The government will pay the interest.\nNo payments are expected during this period. You do not have to take any steps or provide any proof to benefit from this exceptional measure, since it applies automatically to anyone who has incurred a debt with Aide financière aux études.\nNo. The government will pay the interest. Students are not required to make any payments during this period.\nYes. Contact your financial institution. They will tell you what steps to follow.\nNo. The government has made arrangements with all partner financial institutions to automatically postpone the repayment plan. People who have contracted student loans do not have to take any action.\nNo. Your financial institution will automatically extend the amortization period for your loan by six months and your monthly payments will remain the same.\nYes. This measure applies to all outstanding amounts, whether owed to a financial institution or in collection with Aide financière aux études.\nFor the next six months, you will not be required to make repayments of your student loan.\nYour Deferred Payment Plan is also suspended for six months.\nAfter this postponement ends, your Deferred Payment Plan will continue for the rest of the time remaining in it.\nNo. This postponement is not included in the 60 months of eligibility for the Deferred Payment Plan.\nNo. This postponement applies only to student loans contracted under a program offered by the Aide financière aux études department of the Ministère de l’Éducation et de l’Enseignement supérieur.\nIf you have questions about lines of credit and other student loans offered by your financial institution, please contact the staff there directly.\nThe modifications to the different administrative procedures announced for educational institutions apply to both Québec and international students. It is recommended that any information that may be of interest on this page be consulted as it pertains to all students.\nInternational students will be entitled to the [Canada Emergency Response Benefit ](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/cerb-application.html) (CERB) if they meet the program eligibility criteria, particularly:\n*   Have declared an income of at least $5000, earned in Canada or outside the country, during the last fiscal year or during the 12 months prior to their application. Applicants must be Canadian residents.\n*   Have stopped working in relation to the COVID-19 crisis, without having left their employment voluntarily. Thus, they are not eligible if they stopped working before the crisis began.\nNo measure is currently planned for this specific purpose.\nThe repatriation of foreign nationals is usually the responsibility of their country of origin.\nNo measure is currently planned for this specific purpose.No measure is currently planned for this specific purpose.\nNo measure is currently planned for this specific purpose.\nHowever, the Ministère has encouraged educational institutions to offer special support and possibly implement measures to help international students who may find themselves in a precarious situation.\nInternational students will be able to leave Canada based on available flights or may choose to stay in Canada if they have yet to complete their studies, provided that their immigration documents are in order.\nInstitutions are encouraged to continue processing all applications so as to not delay the subsequent steps required for international students to begin their studies at the chosen institution.\nInternational students must have a valid Québec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ) and study permit when they begin their classes. To obtain these documents, students must have a proof of admission.\nNote that international students are not required to obtain a CAQ and a study permit prior to starting a program of study through distance education while they are not residing in Canada. However, they will need to obtain these documents before being authorized to enter the country to complete their program in person, as needed.\nInternational students can attend distance courses, just like Québec students.\nImmigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has not announced the automatic renewal of temporary residency permits. Students are asked to submit a request for renewal before the date on which their permit expires. If students meet this condition, they are granted “implied status,” meaning that their current temporary residency is maintained until a decision is made regarding their application. International students are requested not to go to border crossings in an attempt to renew their immigration documents. The most up-to-date information is usually published by the [federal government](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/coronavirus-covid19/visitors-foreign-workers-students.html) .\nThe Ministère de l’Immigration, de la Francisation et de l’Intégration (MIFI) is extending, until December 31, 2020, the minister’s consent for the duration of the stay in Québec of international students whose Québec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ) for studies expires as of April 30, 2020 and before December 31, 2020. This regulation applies to students whose CAQ had not already expired on April 30, 2020.\nTemporary residents must maintain valid temporary resident status at all times. The Ministère de l’Immigration, de la Francisation et de l’intégration (MIFI) continues to process applications for temporary selection.\nStudents who were already studying in Canada and whose courses were moved online due to the travel restrictions and public health measures introduced because of COVID-19 will not be penalized and will retain their eligibility for the PGWPP, including the length of the work permit to which they would be entitled. However, these students must continue at least 50 % of their program of study in Canada to be eligible for the PGWPP.\nThe IRCC has introduced a new temporary policy for students who currently hold a study permit or who were approved for a study permit for a program set to begin in May or June 2020, but who are unable to enter Canada due to the current travel restrictions. If courses of study are delivered online exceptionally because of COVID-19, the eligibility of these students for the Post-Graduation Work Permit Program (PGWPP) will not be affected. International students in this situation can begin their courses from outside Canada and complete up to 50% of their program from outside the country if they cannot travel to Canada earlier.\ninternational students are not required to obtain a Québec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ) and a study permit to study through distance education. However, they will need to obtain these documents before being authorized to enter the country to complete their program in person, as needed.\nIt is important to note that students whose study permits were issued no later than March 18, 2020, are exempt from the [travel restrictions in place in Canada ](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/coronavirus-covid19/visitors-foreign-workers-students.html) and are therefore allowed to enter the country. However, they must not be experiencing any symptoms prior to boarding their flight and must undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine period upon their arrival.\nFor information on health protection, foreign nationals can refer to the Questions and answers about our services during the pandemic page on the [Régie de l’assurance maladie du Québec website](https://www.ramq.gouv.qc.ca/en/regie/press-room/Pages/questions-answers-services-during-pandemic.aspx) , specifically the following sections:\n*   COVID-19: Information and screening – What coverage does Québec provide for COVID-19 screening and care? \n*   Foreign workers and students in Québec: health insurance coverage\nThe Ministère de l’Immigration, de la Francisation et de l’Intégration (MIFI) is extending, until December 31, 2020, the minister’s consent for the duration of the stay in Québec of international students whose Québec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ) for studies expires as of April 30, 2020 and before December 31, 2020. This regulation applies to students whose CAQ had not already expired on April 30, 2020.\nThis decision is intended to facilitate the steps that must be taken by inernational students who were in the process of completing their study program but who must extend their stay in Québec due to the current health state of emergency and the temporary interruption of their courses.\nThese students can therefore submit an application to the federal government as soon as possible to have their study permit extended without having to include a new CAQ, which will allow them to maintain valid temporary residence status and to complete their study program when their courses resume.\nNo, international students will not have to pay any fees for extending their CAQ, since the required fees were already paid when they submitted their application for the CAQ that they obtained.\nInternational students who would like to extend their stay in Québec for studies beyond December 31, 2020, in order to complete a study program or to begin a new program in the fall 2020 semester, must submit a new application for a CAQ for studies to the MIFI and a new application for a study permit to the federal government. In all cases, students should start the required immigration procedures at least three months before their current authorization for studies expires.\nInternational students who have earned their degree can submit an application for permanent selection under the PEQ if they have been awarded, by an educational institution in Québec, within three years of the date of submission of their application, one of the following:\n*   a university diploma attesting to a bachelor’s, a master’s or a doctoral degree\n*   a college diploma for technical studies or a vocational diploma at the secondary level, with or without attestation of vocational specialization, obtained consecutively, attesting to 1800 hours or more of consecutive study and leading to a trade\nThe Ministère accepts attestations of successful completion of a study program as well as a final transcripts issued by the registrar of the educational institution. Since the programs admissible under the PEQ must have a minimum duration of 1800 hours, these graduates can obtain a three-year post-graduation work permit. The duration of this permit gives them all the time they need to submit an application for permanent selection under the PEQ as graduates or even as temporary foreign workers.\nThe federal government is responsible for issuing study permits.

The exceptions made for the territory of the Montréal metropolitan community also apply for the territory of the regional county municipality of Joliette.\nSecondary schools will remain closed until the end of August, following recommendations by public health authorities. Students will consolidate their distance learning through increased pedagogical support.\nAdministrative centres will continue to carry out essential activities; they therefore remain open. However, until schools reopen in their regions, administrative staff members are asked to work remotely whenever possible.\nPreschools and elementary schools are gradually resuming their activities in all regions of Québec, with the exception of schools located in the [Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal](https://cmm.qc.ca/a-propos/territoires-et-municipalites/)  (In French only) (Montréal metropolitan community, CMM), which will remain closed to students until the end of August. The exceptions made for the territory of the Montréal metropolitan community also apply for the territory of the regional county municipality of Joliette. Some secondary schools will also reopen, specifically public schools that offer regional or supraregional schooling services as well as private schools specialized in special education for students with disabilities or severe behavioral issues. Schools in the Montréal metropolitan community will reopen on May 25, health conditions permitting.\nSecondary schools will remain closed until the end of August, following recommendations by public health authorities.\nAs of May 11, students in these sectors have been able to resume their training in various ways (online courses, distance education), except for students whose schools are located in the Montréal metropolitan community and the regional county municipality of Joliette. These centres will open on May 25. Activities will resume in all training sectors.\nStaff in these sectors will also return to work, either at a distance or in person, depending on the program, while complying with physical distancing rules. Providing training at a distance or working from home should be the preferred delivery method in the current context.\nIf students must be present in person for practical training or certain evaluations, there must never be more than 15 individuals in the same space and physical distancing rules will apply.\nSince May 11, learners in this sector have been able to resume their training in various ways (online courses, distance education), except for learners whose centres are located in the Montréal metropolitan community and the regional county municipality of Joliette. These centres will open on May 25.\nAs of May 11 (May 25 for the Montréal metropolitan community and the regional county municipality of Joliette), adult education centres will be open for evaluations only. However, if students must be present in person for certain evaluations, there must never be more than 15 individuals in the same space and physical distancing rules will apply.\nThe measures put in place in the French sector will also apply in the English sector.\nIn general, elementary schools tend to be smaller than secondary schools. Secondary school students are more independent and are in a better position to finish their school year through distance learning.\nTeachers will provide pedagogical support, and sites such as [ecoleouverte.ca](https://ecoleouverte.ca/en/) , and educational activities kits will continue to be made available to elementary students, particularly those whose parents choose not to send them back to school.\nParents are not obliged to send their children back to school. Parents may decide to send them back to school after May 11, but they must give the school administration one week’s notice to allow for the organization of school transportation and pedagogical supervision in the classrooms.\nSchool organization will be based on public health recommendations, which are constantly evolving and can vary from region to region.\nEach school will take measures to respect the physical distancing recommendation of maintaining at least 2 metres between students. Where possible while following this recommendation, each group can have a maximum of 15 students.\nA variety of means can be used for groups where more than 15 students wish to return to school, such as reforming different groups of students at the same grade level, with each group staying in the same classroom until the end of the school year while respecting the 2-metre rule between individuals, for example.\nVisitors will not be allowed to enter the school.\nThe premises will be subject to regular, appropriate maintenance to ensure their cleanliness. Efforts will be made to raise awareness about proper handwashing and respiratory hygiene.\nHygiene and sanitation measures are being implemented in schools, as per public health recommendations.\nEach school will take measures to ensure that students stay the recommended 2 metres apart.\nSchool teams must carefully plan student groups according to the space they have available. It is possible that a child might not return to their usual classroom, as the groups will have to be smaller than usual.\nSchool teams must be particularly careful to set up the necessary supervision so that students remain at least 2 metres apart and wash their hands regularly. It is essential that teachers and parents collaborate in explaining these rules to the children.\nThe application of public health rules is at the heart of this return to normal life. Incidentally, 15 is the maximum number of children allowed per group, but fewer than 15 will be accepted into a group if a classroom is too small for it to respect the 2-metre physical distancing rule. Children will be assigned to a group and to a teacher, and measures will be taken to ensure that large groups of children are never in contact or together at the same time, such as having staggered recess times, with small groups of children.\nSchool organization will certainly look different. However, since the beginning of the pandemic, emergency daycare services have been set up in more than 350 elementary schools all across Québec and have managed to adapt to the new measures.\nOn the strength of the experience acquired in this context, and in collaboration with the public health authorities in each region, the school teams will ensure the safety of children and staff with care and vigilance.\nEach school will take steps to enforce physical distancing rules, thereby making sure to reduce the risk level.\nDifferent methods can be used if a group of more than 15 students wishes to return to school, such as reforming different groups of students at the same grade level, with each group staying in the same classroom until the end of the school year while respecting the 2-metre rule, for example.\nSchools will have to limit travel within the school, minimize times when groups travel at the same time and use staggered schedules.\nThey will use one room for classes, lunch and daycare. They will take turns using the schoolyard. Students must wash their hands regularly and avoid physical contact with each other.\nElementary schools are given the flexibility to adjust their schedules. For example, students could arrive and leave at different times to avoid gatherings.\nNo, wearing a mask is not compulsory. However, the government has confirmed that face coverings may be provided to teachers who request them.\nMeasures will also be taken by each educational institution to comply with the physical distancing rule of maintaining 2 metres between students.\nStudents or staff members with symptoms of COVID-19 must not enter the school. Any person who receives a diagnosis of COVID-19 must comply with a 14-day isolation period.\nNo. Like the rest of the population, students who are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms must stay at home and contact a health care professional. A [Self-Care Guide](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/self-care-guide-covid-19/) with information on the necessary steps to take has been made available to Quebecers. More information on the health guidelines to follow, especially who to contact in order to get tested, is available on [Québec.ca](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/).\nParents are not obliged to send their children back to school. However, returning to school is not recommended before September 2020 for children who are vulnerable for health reasons (chronic disease, severe immunodeficiency, etc.). Pedagogical support will be provided to these students.\nParents do not have the obligation to send their children back to school. However, as a precautionary measure, the presence at school of a child whose parents have a health vulnerability (chronic disease, severe immunodeficiency, pregnancy or person aged 70 or over) should rather be privileged from September 2020. By then, parents could opt for distance learning, with the support of members of the school staff.\nSchool attendance will remain non-compulsory until the end of the school year. Pedagogical support will be provided by teachers to all of their students, including those who do not return to the classroom. Those students will be provided with schoolwork by their teachers, who will also carry out a weekly follow-up with them.\nSince student advancement to the next grade level is determined by teachers’ professional judgment, teachers will be able to use online schoolwork or evaluations to validate their judgments of certain learning content.\nIn addition, in order to continue fostering learning by preschool, elementary and secondary students, the Ministère will continue to offer educational activities on the [Open School ](https://www.ecoleouverte.ca/en/) and on Télé-Québec. website and on Télé-Québec.\nVulnerable students are strongly encouraged to return to the classroom as soon as possible to be able to benefit from optimal pedagogical support. School staff will contact the parents to reassure them and provide appropriate support during the return to the classroom.\nThe members of the school teams will increase the weekly personalized follow-up with their students, giving priority to the most vulnerable students and using—for students who are not in the classroom—a technological tool allowing direct contact (e.g. telephone, video call).\nBeing present on the school premises is not recommended for staff members who are vulnerable for health reasons (chronic disease, severe immunodeficiency, pregnancy or aged 70 or older). For health and safety reasons, these staff members are encouraged to delay their return to school until September 2020.\nAs soon as a case is confirmed, the child is isolated in a room and cannot return to school for a period of 14 days. Schools have received an emergency kit to be used when a case of COVID-19 is confirmed.\nThe public health authority in the region concerned will assess the situation and issue appropriate instructions.\nAnyone who presents [symptoms associated with COVID-19](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/general-information-about-coronavirus/#c46469) must immediately leave the school premises, call 1-877-644-4545 and follow the instructions they are given. Pedagogical support will be provided to students during their absence from school.\nYes, school transportation will resume as soon as schools reopen, and the routes will be established based on the needs. Strict measures determined by the public health authority must be respected, including a limit of one child per bench. Every second bench must remain empty. The driver must be provided with a protective zone. In the event it is not possible to create a protective zone, drivers may wear the protective equipment provided.\nIt is recommended that parents transport their child to school until the end of the school year if they are able to do so.\nParents must inform the school as to whether they want their child to use school transportation, and the school will organize transportation based on the needs.\nIt is recommended that parents transport their child to school until the end of the school year if they are able to do so.\nStarting on May 11, as preschools and elementary schools in some regions reopen, school daycare services will resume regular operations in every school. Any family with children enrolled at a school can register for that school’s daycare services, if needed, by following the standard local procedures.\nIn the Montréal metropolitan community, emergency daycare services will remain open until the end of the school year. The exceptions made for the territory of the Montréal metropolitan community also apply for the territory of the regional county municipality of Joliette.\nAs this is a return to normal activities, students must register directly at the school where they are enrolled.\nThe main objective of the return to the classroom and of the support for students remaining at home will be to reinforce the essential learning required to move up to the next grade level.\nNo, the school year will not be extended into summer.\nStudent advancement to the next grade level will be determined by the students’ evaluations carried out before schools closed on March 13. In addition, teachers are asked to determine the students’ results for the last report card based on their knowledge of the students’ acquired learning.\nNo matter the level, schools must plan for a review period at the beginning of the 2020-2021 school year.\nAt the moment, it is difficult to predict the needs for educational staff as the number of students that will be present in schools is not yet known. However, the limitations imposed by physical distancing, that is, maintaining 2 metres between individuals, and the exclusion of employees who are vulnerable for health reasons will create added pressure on the availability of elementary school teachers. If necessary, secondary school teachers on permanent contracts will be asked to step in, with the support of professionals and support staff in elementary schools. The order allowing for this redeployment of resources must come from a reassignment measure from the local union, if necessary.\nNo. The ministerial examinations will not be administered. Students were unable to acquire all the learning targeted by the programs of study because of the health crisis that caused educational services to be suspended for a considerable amount of time.\nThe government can, if the circumstances warrant it, cancel an examination and use the marks awarded by the school as a final grade. Due to the current exceptional circumstances, the ministerial examinations will be cancelled, and the school results will be taken into account in the awarding of diplomas. Students will move up to the next grade level based on the teachers’ professional judgment and the students’ previous results on the first two report cards.\nNon-essential activities like infrastructure sharing are temporarily interrupted in order to slow the spread of the virus, as a public health measure. Related activities such as room rentals as well as sports and cultural activities are also targeted by the closure.\nA massive open [online course](https://jenseigneadistance.teluq.ca/)  (In French only) is available, free of charge, for teachers who wish to improve their understanding of how technological tools can be used to provide support.\nCollege- and university-level teaching activities will continue at a distance for the Summer 2020 term, until September, except in the case of practical training that cannot be carried out remotely and that is necessary to enable students to continue their studies in order to graduate.\nResearch activities in colleges, in the Centres collégiaux de transfert de technologie and in universities may resume. Accordingly, research activities related to the health, science, agriculture, forestry and engineering sectors, as well as vital seasonal outdoor activities, the resumption of which is urgently awaited, may now begin. The resumption of activities in all other research sectors should also be considered if these sectors are directly related to the collective effort to relaunch the economy.\nMoreover, institutions of higher education may resume any activity they deem necessary and may authorize some of their employees to return to the workplace. Whenever possible, remote work must still be the preferred approach when resuming these activities.\nAll of the above is conditional upon compliance with the guidelines issued by the competent authorities, namely the Direction de santé publique, the CNESST and the IRSST.\nIf internship settings have confirmed the continuation of the internship, the students’ workplace respects the guidelines issued by the public health authority, and the students are able to complete the internship, for example, by working remotely, then internships are possible. However, students cannot be penalized for their inability to meet requirements.\nIt is up to each institution to establish learning and evaluation procedures it deems appropriate in order to ensure that students develop the competencies required to complete their program of study and to graduate. Students should not be penalized for their inability to complete their program through alternative means developed by their institution.\n**Compiling of a list of students and materials**\nStudents may collect their personal effects once they have been invited to do so by the administration of the institution and in compliance with the hygiene measures issued by the Direction de Santé publique.\n**Access to educational institutions**\nThis is an exceptional procedure that aims to meet the most urgent needs of students, teachers and professors. The Ministère will not establish specific categories; rather, it will call upon institutions to identify the persons concerned as well as the order of priority.\nExceptionally, and for this purpose only, each institution must establish an adapted procedure that ensures compliance with physical distancing guidelines, particularly by tightly controlling the number of people who can access the institution’s premises. Anyone accessing a building on the institution’s premises must wash their hands upon entering and leaving. Students must be supervised when moving about the premises in order to minimize any risks.\nThe administration must establish a precise schedule in order to control the number of people present at any given time and to ensure that necessary services are available to students and teachers with special needs. If necessary, the administration may contact its regional public health agency to obtain further information.\nThese guidelines must be followed at all times:\n*   Handwashing is mandatory when entering a building.\n*   Physical distancing must be maintained and there must be no contact between individuals.\n*   Students cannot be accompanied by another person.\n*   Anyone experiencing flu-like symptoms must be excluded from this operation.\nAll Explore 2020 spring and summer sessions have been cancelled.\nFinancial assistance will continue to be available for students whose period of studies may be lengthened.\nFor the moment, the student financial assistance program has not been modified. Payments will continue to be issued.\nThe income taken into account when calculating the 2019-2020 financial assistance is that of the 2019 calendar year. For that reason, any fluctuations in the students’ income in 2020 are not considered for 2019-2020. In some cases, they may, however, affect the calculations for 2020-2021. The government has announced that it will be postponing repayment of any loans incurred under the Loans and Bursaries Program and the Loans Program for Part-Time Studies for a period of six months.\nThe Loans and Bursaries Program already accounts for the financial needs of people who are caring for children. Students who have lost their jobs due to the current situation may apply for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.\nThe Minister of Education and Higher Education is currently studying the best ways to increase the amount of financial assistance awarded to students in Québec and is collaborating with the federal government to ensure financing. Announcements to student associations are planned in the coming weeks to prepare for a rollout in Fall 2020.\nNo, the government has announced that repayments of all loans contracted under the Loans and Bursaries Program and the Loans for Part-Time Studies Program are postponed for a period of six months. The government will pay the interest.\nNo payments are expected during this period. You do not have to take any steps or provide any proof to benefit from this exceptional measure, since it applies automatically to anyone who has incurred a debt with Aide financière aux études.\nNo. The government will pay the interest. Students are not required to make any payments during this period.\nYes. Contact your financial institution. They will tell you what steps to follow.\nNo. The government has made arrangements with all partner financial institutions to automatically postpone the repayment plan. People who have contracted student loans do not have to take any action.\nNo. Your financial institution will automatically extend the amortization period for your loan by six months and your monthly payments will remain the same.\nYes. This measure applies to all outstanding amounts, whether owed to a financial institution or in collection with Aide financière aux études.\nFor the next six months, you will not be required to make repayments of your student loan.\nYour Deferred Payment Plan is also suspended for six months.\nAfter this postponement ends, your Deferred Payment Plan will continue for the rest of the time remaining in it.\nNo. This postponement is not included in the 60 months of eligibility for the Deferred Payment Plan.\nNo. This postponement applies only to student loans contracted under a program offered by the Aide financière aux études department of the Ministère de l’Éducation et de l’Enseignement supérieur.\nIf you have questions about lines of credit and other student loans offered by your financial institution, please contact the staff there directly.\nThe modifications to the different administrative procedures announced for educational institutions apply to both Québec and international students. It is recommended that any information that may be of interest on this page be consulted as it pertains to all students.\nInternational students will be entitled to the [Canada Emergency Response Benefit ](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/cerb-application.html) (CERB) if they meet the program eligibility criteria, particularly:\n*   Have declared an income of at least $5000, earned in Canada or outside the country, during the last fiscal year or during the 12 months prior to their application. Applicants must be Canadian residents.\n*   Have stopped working in relation to the COVID-19 crisis, without having left their employment voluntarily. Thus, they are not eligible if they stopped working before the crisis began.\nNo measure is currently planned for this specific purpose.\nThe repatriation of foreign nationals is usually the responsibility of their country of origin.\nNo measure is currently planned for this specific purpose.No measure is currently planned for this specific purpose.\nNo measure is currently planned for this specific purpose.\nHowever, the Ministère has encouraged educational institutions to offer special support and possibly implement measures to help international students who may find themselves in a precarious situation.\nInternational students will be able to leave Canada based on available flights or may choose to stay in Canada if they have yet to complete their studies, provided that their immigration documents are in order.\nInstitutions are encouraged to continue processing all applications so as to not delay the subsequent steps required for international students to begin their studies at the chosen institution.\nInternational students must have a valid Québec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ) and study permit when they begin their classes. To obtain these documents, students must have a proof of admission.\nNote that international students are not required to obtain a CAQ and a study permit prior to starting a program of study through distance education while they are not residing in Canada. However, they will need to obtain these documents before being authorized to enter the country to complete their program in person, as needed.\nInternational students can attend distance courses, just like Québec students.\nImmigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has not announced the automatic renewal of temporary residency permits. Students are asked to submit a request for renewal before the date on which their permit expires. If students meet this condition, they are granted “implied status,” meaning that their current temporary residency is maintained until a decision is made regarding their application. International students are requested not to go to border crossings in an attempt to renew their immigration documents. The most up-to-date information is usually published by the [federal government](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/coronavirus-covid19/visitors-foreign-workers-students.html) .\nThe Ministère de l’Immigration, de la Francisation et de l’Intégration (MIFI) is extending, until December 31, 2020, the minister’s consent for the duration of the stay in Québec of international students whose Québec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ) for studies expires as of April 30, 2020 and before December 31, 2020. This regulation applies to students whose CAQ had not already expired on April 30, 2020.\nTemporary residents must maintain valid temporary resident status at all times. The Ministère de l’Immigration, de la Francisation et de l’intégration (MIFI) continues to process applications for temporary selection.\nStudents who were already studying in Canada and whose courses were moved online due to the travel restrictions and public health measures introduced because of COVID-19 will not be penalized and will retain their eligibility for the PGWPP, including the length of the work permit to which they would be entitled. However, these students must continue at least 50 % of their program of study in Canada to be eligible for the PGWPP.\nThe IRCC has introduced a new temporary policy for students who currently hold a study permit or who were approved for a study permit for a program set to begin in May or June 2020, but who are unable to enter Canada due to the current travel restrictions. If courses of study are delivered online exceptionally because of COVID-19, the eligibility of these students for the Post-Graduation Work Permit Program (PGWPP) will not be affected. International students in this situation can begin their courses from outside Canada and complete up to 50% of their program from outside the country if they cannot travel to Canada earlier.\ninternational students are not required to obtain a Québec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ) and a study permit to study through distance education. However, they will need to obtain these documents before being authorized to enter the country to complete their program in person, as needed.\nIt is important to note that students whose study permits were issued no later than March 18, 2020, are exempt from the [travel restrictions in place in Canada ](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/coronavirus-covid19/visitors-foreign-workers-students.html) and are therefore allowed to enter the country. However, they must not be experiencing any symptoms prior to boarding their flight and must undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine period upon their arrival.\nFor information on health protection, foreign nationals can refer to the Questions and answers about our services during the pandemic page on the [Régie de l’assurance maladie du Québec website](https://www.ramq.gouv.qc.ca/en/regie/press-room/Pages/questions-answers-services-during-pandemic.aspx) , specifically the following sections:\n*   COVID-19: Information and screening – What coverage does Québec provide for COVID-19 screening and care? \n*   Foreign workers and students in Québec: health insurance coverage\nThe Ministère de l’Immigration, de la Francisation et de l’Intégration (MIFI) is extending, until December 31, 2020, the minister’s consent for the duration of the stay in Québec of international students whose Québec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ) for studies expires as of April 30, 2020 and before December 31, 2020. This regulation applies to students whose CAQ had not already expired on April 30, 2020.\nThis decision is intended to facilitate the steps that must be taken by inernational students who were in the process of completing their study program but who must extend their stay in Québec due to the current health state of emergency and the temporary interruption of their courses.\nThese students can therefore submit an application to the federal government as soon as possible to have their study permit extended without having to include a new CAQ, which will allow them to maintain valid temporary residence status and to complete their study program when their courses resume.\nNo, international students will not have to pay any fees for extending their CAQ, since the required fees were already paid when they submitted their application for the CAQ that they obtained.\nInternational students who would like to extend their stay in Québec for studies beyond December 31, 2020, in order to complete a study program or to begin a new program in the fall 2020 semester, must submit a new application for a CAQ for studies to the MIFI and a new application for a study permit to the federal government. In all cases, students should start the required immigration procedures at least three months before their current authorization for studies expires.\nInternational students who have earned their degree can submit an application for permanent selection under the PEQ if they have been awarded, by an educational institution in Québec, within three years of the date of submission of their application, one of the following:\n*   a university diploma attesting to a bachelor’s, a master’s or a doctoral degree\n*   a college diploma for technical studies or a vocational diploma at the secondary level, with or without attestation of vocational specialization, obtained consecutively, attesting to 1800 hours or more of consecutive study and leading to a trade\nThe Ministère accepts attestations of successful completion of a study program as well as a final transcripts issued by the registrar of the educational institution. Since the programs admissible under the PEQ must have a minimum duration of 1800 hours, these graduates can obtain a three-year post-graduation work permit. The duration of this permit gives them all the time they need to submit an application for permanent selection under the PEQ as graduates or even as temporary foreign workers.\nThe federal government is responsible for issuing study permits.

The exceptions made for the territory of the Montréal metropolitan community also apply for the territory of the regional county municipality of Joliette.\nSecondary schools will remain closed until the end of August, following recommendations by public health authorities. Students will consolidate their distance learning through increased pedagogical support.\nAdministrative centres will continue to carry out essential activities; they therefore remain open. However, until schools reopen in their regions, administrative staff members are asked to work remotely whenever possible.\nPreschools and elementary schools are gradually resuming their activities in all regions of Québec, with the exception of schools located in the [Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal](https://cmm.qc.ca/a-propos/territoires-et-municipalites/)  (In French only) (Montréal metropolitan community, CMM), which will remain closed to students until the end of August. The exceptions made for the territory of the Montréal metropolitan community also apply for the territory of the regional county municipality of Joliette. Some secondary schools will also reopen, specifically public schools that offer regional or supraregional schooling services as well as private schools specialized in special education for students with disabilities or severe behavioral issues. Schools in the Montréal metropolitan community will reopen on May 25, health conditions permitting.\nSecondary schools will remain closed until the end of August, following recommendations by public health authorities.\nAs of May 11, students in these sectors have been able to resume their training in various ways (online courses, distance education), except for students whose schools are located in the Montréal metropolitan community and the regional county municipality of Joliette. These centres will open on May 25. Activities will resume in all training sectors.\nStaff in these sectors will also return to work, either at a distance or in person, depending on the program, while complying with physical distancing rules. Providing training at a distance or working from home should be the preferred delivery method in the current context.\nIf students must be present in person for practical training or certain evaluations, there must never be more than 15 individuals in the same space and physical distancing rules will apply.\nSince May 11, learners in this sector have been able to resume their training in various ways (online courses, distance education), except for learners whose centres are located in the Montréal metropolitan community and the regional county municipality of Joliette. These centres will open on May 25.\nAs of May 11 (May 25 for the Montréal metropolitan community and the regional county municipality of Joliette), adult education centres will be open for evaluations only. However, if students must be present in person for certain evaluations, there must never be more than 15 individuals in the same space and physical distancing rules will apply.\nThe measures put in place in the French sector will also apply in the English sector.\nIn general, elementary schools tend to be smaller than secondary schools. Secondary school students are more independent and are in a better position to finish their school year through distance learning.\nTeachers will provide pedagogical support, and sites such as [ecoleouverte.ca](https://ecoleouverte.ca/en/) , and educational activities kits will continue to be made available to elementary students, particularly those whose parents choose not to send them back to school.\nParents are not obliged to send their children back to school. Parents may decide to send them back to school after May 11, but they must give the school administration one week’s notice to allow for the organization of school transportation and pedagogical supervision in the classrooms.\nSchool organization will be based on public health recommendations, which are constantly evolving and can vary from region to region.\nEach school will take measures to respect the physical distancing recommendation of maintaining at least 2 metres between students. Where possible while following this recommendation, each group can have a maximum of 15 students.\nA variety of means can be used for groups where more than 15 students wish to return to school, such as reforming different groups of students at the same grade level, with each group staying in the same classroom until the end of the school year while respecting the 2-metre rule between individuals, for example.\nVisitors will not be allowed to enter the school.\nThe premises will be subject to regular, appropriate maintenance to ensure their cleanliness. Efforts will be made to raise awareness about proper handwashing and respiratory hygiene.\nHygiene and sanitation measures are being implemented in schools, as per public health recommendations.\nEach school will take measures to ensure that students stay the recommended 2 metres apart.\nSchool teams must carefully plan student groups according to the space they have available. It is possible that a child might not return to their usual classroom, as the groups will have to be smaller than usual.\nSchool teams must be particularly careful to set up the necessary supervision so that students remain at least 2 metres apart and wash their hands regularly. It is essential that teachers and parents collaborate in explaining these rules to the children.\nThe application of public health rules is at the heart of this return to normal life. Incidentally, 15 is the maximum number of children allowed per group, but fewer than 15 will be accepted into a group if a classroom is too small for it to respect the 2-metre physical distancing rule. Children will be assigned to a group and to a teacher, and measures will be taken to ensure that large groups of children are never in contact or together at the same time, such as having staggered recess times, with small groups of children.\nSchool organization will certainly look different. However, since the beginning of the pandemic, emergency daycare services have been set up in more than 350 elementary schools all across Québec and have managed to adapt to the new measures.\nOn the strength of the experience acquired in this context, and in collaboration with the public health authorities in each region, the school teams will ensure the safety of children and staff with care and vigilance.\nEach school will take steps to enforce physical distancing rules, thereby making sure to reduce the risk level.\nDifferent methods can be used if a group of more than 15 students wishes to return to school, such as reforming different groups of students at the same grade level, with each group staying in the same classroom until the end of the school year while respecting the 2-metre rule, for example.\nSchools will have to limit travel within the school, minimize times when groups travel at the same time and use staggered schedules.\nThey will use one room for classes, lunch and daycare. They will take turns using the schoolyard. Students must wash their hands regularly and avoid physical contact with each other.\nElementary schools are given the flexibility to adjust their schedules. For example, students could arrive and leave at different times to avoid gatherings.\nNo, wearing a mask is not compulsory. However, the government has confirmed that face coverings may be provided to teachers who request them.\nMeasures will also be taken by each educational institution to comply with the physical distancing rule of maintaining 2 metres between students.\nStudents or staff members with symptoms of COVID-19 must not enter the school. Any person who receives a diagnosis of COVID-19 must comply with a 14-day isolation period.\nNo. Like the rest of the population, students who are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms must stay at home and contact a health care professional. A [Self-Care Guide](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/self-care-guide-covid-19/) with information on the necessary steps to take has been made available to Quebecers. More information on the health guidelines to follow, especially who to contact in order to get tested, is available on [Québec.ca](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/).\nParents are not obliged to send their children back to school. However, returning to school is not recommended before September 2020 for children who are vulnerable for health reasons (chronic disease, severe immunodeficiency, etc.). Pedagogical support will be provided to these students.\nParents do not have the obligation to send their children back to school. However, as a precautionary measure, the presence at school of a child whose parents have a health vulnerability (chronic disease, severe immunodeficiency, pregnancy or person aged 70 or over) should rather be privileged from September 2020. By then, parents could opt for distance learning, with the support of members of the school staff.\nSchool attendance will remain non-compulsory until the end of the school year. Pedagogical support will be provided by teachers to all of their students, including those who do not return to the classroom. Those students will be provided with schoolwork by their teachers, who will also carry out a weekly follow-up with them.\nSince student advancement to the next grade level is determined by teachers’ professional judgment, teachers will be able to use online schoolwork or evaluations to validate their judgments of certain learning content.\nIn addition, in order to continue fostering learning by preschool, elementary and secondary students, the Ministère will continue to offer educational activities on the [Open School ](https://www.ecoleouverte.ca/en/) and on Télé-Québec. website and on Télé-Québec.\nVulnerable students are strongly encouraged to return to the classroom as soon as possible to be able to benefit from optimal pedagogical support. School staff will contact the parents to reassure them and provide appropriate support during the return to the classroom.\nThe members of the school teams will increase the weekly personalized follow-up with their students, giving priority to the most vulnerable students and using—for students who are not in the classroom—a technological tool allowing direct contact (e.g. telephone, video call).\nBeing present on the school premises is not recommended for staff members who are vulnerable for health reasons (chronic disease, severe immunodeficiency, pregnancy or aged 70 or older). For health and safety reasons, these staff members are encouraged to delay their return to school until September 2020.\nAs soon as a case is confirmed, the child is isolated in a room and cannot return to school for a period of 14 days. Schools have received an emergency kit to be used when a case of COVID-19 is confirmed.\nThe public health authority in the region concerned will assess the situation and issue appropriate instructions.\nAnyone who presents [symptoms associated with COVID-19](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/general-information-about-coronavirus/#c46469) must immediately leave the school premises, call 1-877-644-4545 and follow the instructions they are given. Pedagogical support will be provided to students during their absence from school.\nYes, school transportation will resume as soon as schools reopen, and the routes will be established based on the needs. Strict measures determined by the public health authority must be respected, including a limit of one child per bench. Every second bench must remain empty. The driver must be provided with a protective zone. In the event it is not possible to create a protective zone, drivers may wear the protective equipment provided.\nIt is recommended that parents transport their child to school until the end of the school year if they are able to do so.\nParents must inform the school as to whether they want their child to use school transportation, and the school will organize transportation based on the needs.\nIt is recommended that parents transport their child to school until the end of the school year if they are able to do so.\nStarting on May 11, as preschools and elementary schools in some regions reopen, school daycare services will resume regular operations in every school. Any family with children enrolled at a school can register for that school’s daycare services, if needed, by following the standard local procedures.\nIn the Montréal metropolitan community, emergency daycare services will remain open until the end of the school year. The exceptions made for the territory of the Montréal metropolitan community also apply for the territory of the regional county municipality of Joliette.\nAs this is a return to normal activities, students must register directly at the school where they are enrolled.\nThe main objective of the return to the classroom and of the support for students remaining at home will be to reinforce the essential learning required to move up to the next grade level.\nNo, the school year will not be extended into summer.\nStudent advancement to the next grade level will be determined by the students’ evaluations carried out before schools closed on March 13. In addition, teachers are asked to determine the students’ results for the last report card based on their knowledge of the students’ acquired learning.\nNo matter the level, schools must plan for a review period at the beginning of the 2020-2021 school year.\nAt the moment, it is difficult to predict the needs for educational staff as the number of students that will be present in schools is not yet known. However, the limitations imposed by physical distancing, that is, maintaining 2 metres between individuals, and the exclusion of employees who are vulnerable for health reasons will create added pressure on the availability of elementary school teachers. If necessary, secondary school teachers on permanent contracts will be asked to step in, with the support of professionals and support staff in elementary schools. The order allowing for this redeployment of resources must come from a reassignment measure from the local union, if necessary.\nNo. The ministerial examinations will not be administered. Students were unable to acquire all the learning targeted by the programs of study because of the health crisis that caused educational services to be suspended for a considerable amount of time.\nThe government can, if the circumstances warrant it, cancel an examination and use the marks awarded by the school as a final grade. Due to the current exceptional circumstances, the ministerial examinations will be cancelled, and the school results will be taken into account in the awarding of diplomas. Students will move up to the next grade level based on the teachers’ professional judgment and the students’ previous results on the first two report cards.\nNon-essential activities like infrastructure sharing are temporarily interrupted in order to slow the spread of the virus, as a public health measure. Related activities such as room rentals as well as sports and cultural activities are also targeted by the closure.\nA massive open [online course](https://jenseigneadistance.teluq.ca/)  (In French only) is available, free of charge, for teachers who wish to improve their understanding of how technological tools can be used to provide support.\nCollege- and university-level teaching activities will continue at a distance for the Summer 2020 term, until September, except in the case of practical training that cannot be carried out remotely and that is necessary to enable students to continue their studies in order to graduate.\nResearch activities in colleges, in the Centres collégiaux de transfert de technologie and in universities may resume. Accordingly, research activities related to the health, science, agriculture, forestry and engineering sectors, as well as vital seasonal outdoor activities, the resumption of which is urgently awaited, may now begin. The resumption of activities in all other research sectors should also be considered if these sectors are directly related to the collective effort to relaunch the economy.\nMoreover, institutions of higher education may resume any activity they deem necessary and may authorize some of their employees to return to the workplace. Whenever possible, remote work must still be the preferred approach when resuming these activities.\nAll of the above is conditional upon compliance with the guidelines issued by the competent authorities, namely the Direction de santé publique, the CNESST and the IRSST.\nIf internship settings have confirmed the continuation of the internship, the students’ workplace respects the guidelines issued by the public health authority, and the students are able to complete the internship, for example, by working remotely, then internships are possible. However, students cannot be penalized for their inability to meet requirements.\nIt is up to each institution to establish learning and evaluation procedures it deems appropriate in order to ensure that students develop the competencies required to complete their program of study and to graduate. Students should not be penalized for their inability to complete their program through alternative means developed by their institution.\n**Compiling of a list of students and materials**\nStudents may collect their personal effects once they have been invited to do so by the administration of the institution and in compliance with the hygiene measures issued by the Direction de Santé publique.\n**Access to educational institutions**\nThis is an exceptional procedure that aims to meet the most urgent needs of students, teachers and professors. The Ministère will not establish specific categories; rather, it will call upon institutions to identify the persons concerned as well as the order of priority.\nExceptionally, and for this purpose only, each institution must establish an adapted procedure that ensures compliance with physical distancing guidelines, particularly by tightly controlling the number of people who can access the institution’s premises. Anyone accessing a building on the institution’s premises must wash their hands upon entering and leaving. Students must be supervised when moving about the premises in order to minimize any risks.\nThe administration must establish a precise schedule in order to control the number of people present at any given time and to ensure that necessary services are available to students and teachers with special needs. If necessary, the administration may contact its regional public health agency to obtain further information.\nThese guidelines must be followed at all times:\n*   Handwashing is mandatory when entering a building.\n*   Physical distancing must be maintained and there must be no contact between individuals.\n*   Students cannot be accompanied by another person.\n*   Anyone experiencing flu-like symptoms must be excluded from this operation.\nAll Explore 2020 spring and summer sessions have been cancelled.\nFinancial assistance will continue to be available for students whose period of studies may be lengthened.\nFor the moment, the student financial assistance program has not been modified. Payments will continue to be issued.\nThe income taken into account when calculating the 2019-2020 financial assistance is that of the 2019 calendar year. For that reason, any fluctuations in the students’ income in 2020 are not considered for 2019-2020. In some cases, they may, however, affect the calculations for 2020-2021. The government has announced that it will be postponing repayment of any loans incurred under the Loans and Bursaries Program and the Loans Program for Part-Time Studies for a period of six months.\nThe Loans and Bursaries Program already accounts for the financial needs of people who are caring for children. Students who have lost their jobs due to the current situation may apply for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.\nThe Minister of Education and Higher Education is currently studying the best ways to increase the amount of financial assistance awarded to students in Québec and is collaborating with the federal government to ensure financing. Announcements to student associations are planned in the coming weeks to prepare for a rollout in Fall 2020.\nNo, the government has announced that repayments of all loans contracted under the Loans and Bursaries Program and the Loans for Part-Time Studies Program are postponed for a period of six months. The government will pay the interest.\nNo payments are expected during this period. You do not have to take any steps or provide any proof to benefit from this exceptional measure, since it applies automatically to anyone who has incurred a debt with Aide financière aux études.\nNo. The government will pay the interest. Students are not required to make any payments during this period.\nYes. Contact your financial institution. They will tell you what steps to follow.\nNo. The government has made arrangements with all partner financial institutions to automatically postpone the repayment plan. People who have contracted student loans do not have to take any action.\nNo. Your financial institution will automatically extend the amortization period for your loan by six months and your monthly payments will remain the same.\nYes. This measure applies to all outstanding amounts, whether owed to a financial institution or in collection with Aide financière aux études.\nFor the next six months, you will not be required to make repayments of your student loan.\nYour Deferred Payment Plan is also suspended for six months.\nAfter this postponement ends, your Deferred Payment Plan will continue for the rest of the time remaining in it.\nNo. This postponement is not included in the 60 months of eligibility for the Deferred Payment Plan.\nNo. This postponement applies only to student loans contracted under a program offered by the Aide financière aux études department of the Ministère de l’Éducation et de l’Enseignement supérieur.\nIf you have questions about lines of credit and other student loans offered by your financial institution, please contact the staff there directly.\nThe modifications to the different administrative procedures announced for educational institutions apply to both Québec and international students. It is recommended that any information that may be of interest on this page be consulted as it pertains to all students.\nInternational students will be entitled to the [Canada Emergency Response Benefit ](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/cerb-application.html) (CERB) if they meet the program eligibility criteria, particularly:\n*   Have declared an income of at least $5000, earned in Canada or outside the country, during the last fiscal year or during the 12 months prior to their application. Applicants must be Canadian residents.\n*   Have stopped working in relation to the COVID-19 crisis, without having left their employment voluntarily. Thus, they are not eligible if they stopped working before the crisis began.\nNo measure is currently planned for this specific purpose.\nThe repatriation of foreign nationals is usually the responsibility of their country of origin.\nNo measure is currently planned for this specific purpose.No measure is currently planned for this specific purpose.\nNo measure is currently planned for this specific purpose.\nHowever, the Ministère has encouraged educational institutions to offer special support and possibly implement measures to help international students who may find themselves in a precarious situation.\nInternational students will be able to leave Canada based on available flights or may choose to stay in Canada if they have yet to complete their studies, provided that their immigration documents are in order.\nInstitutions are encouraged to continue processing all applications so as to not delay the subsequent steps required for international students to begin their studies at the chosen institution.\nInternational students must have a valid Québec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ) and study permit when they begin their classes. To obtain these documents, students must have a proof of admission.\nNote that international students are not required to obtain a CAQ and a study permit prior to starting a program of study through distance education while they are not residing in Canada. However, they will need to obtain these documents before being authorized to enter the country to complete their program in person, as needed.\nInternational students can attend distance courses, just like Québec students.\nImmigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has not announced the automatic renewal of temporary residency permits. Students are asked to submit a request for renewal before the date on which their permit expires. If students meet this condition, they are granted “implied status,” meaning that their current temporary residency is maintained until a decision is made regarding their application. International students are requested not to go to border crossings in an attempt to renew their immigration documents. The most up-to-date information is usually published by the [federal government](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/coronavirus-covid19/visitors-foreign-workers-students.html) .\nThe Ministère de l’Immigration, de la Francisation et de l’Intégration (MIFI) is extending, until December 31, 2020, the minister’s consent for the duration of the stay in Québec of international students whose Québec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ) for studies expires as of April 30, 2020 and before December 31, 2020. This regulation applies to students whose CAQ had not already expired on April 30, 2020.\nTemporary residents must maintain valid temporary resident status at all times. The Ministère de l’Immigration, de la Francisation et de l’intégration (MIFI) continues to process applications for temporary selection.\nStudents who were already studying in Canada and whose courses were moved online due to the travel restrictions and public health measures introduced because of COVID-19 will not be penalized and will retain their eligibility for the PGWPP, including the length of the work permit to which they would be entitled. However, these students must continue at least 50 % of their program of study in Canada to be eligible for the PGWPP.\nThe IRCC has introduced a new temporary policy for students who currently hold a study permit or who were approved for a study permit for a program set to begin in May or June 2020, but who are unable to enter Canada due to the current travel restrictions. If courses of study are delivered online exceptionally because of COVID-19, the eligibility of these students for the Post-Graduation Work Permit Program (PGWPP) will not be affected. International students in this situation can begin their courses from outside Canada and complete up to 50% of their program from outside the country if they cannot travel to Canada earlier.\ninternational students are not required to obtain a Québec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ) and a study permit to study through distance education. However, they will need to obtain these documents before being authorized to enter the country to complete their program in person, as needed.\nIt is important to note that students whose study permits were issued no later than March 18, 2020, are exempt from the [travel restrictions in place in Canada ](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/coronavirus-covid19/visitors-foreign-workers-students.html) and are therefore allowed to enter the country. However, they must not be experiencing any symptoms prior to boarding their flight and must undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine period upon their arrival.\nFor information on health protection, foreign nationals can refer to the Questions and answers about our services during the pandemic page on the [Régie de l’assurance maladie du Québec website](https://www.ramq.gouv.qc.ca/en/regie/press-room/Pages/questions-answers-services-during-pandemic.aspx) , specifically the following sections:\n*   COVID-19: Information and screening – What coverage does Québec provide for COVID-19 screening and care? \n*   Foreign workers and students in Québec: health insurance coverage\nThe Ministère de l’Immigration, de la Francisation et de l’Intégration (MIFI) is extending, until December 31, 2020, the minister’s consent for the duration of the stay in Québec of international students whose Québec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ) for studies expires as of April 30, 2020 and before December 31, 2020. This regulation applies to students whose CAQ had not already expired on April 30, 2020.\nThis decision is intended to facilitate the steps that must be taken by inernational students who were in the process of completing their study program but who must extend their stay in Québec due to the current health state of emergency and the temporary interruption of their courses.\nThese students can therefore submit an application to the federal government as soon as possible to have their study permit extended without having to include a new CAQ, which will allow them to maintain valid temporary residence status and to complete their study program when their courses resume.\nNo, international students will not have to pay any fees for extending their CAQ, since the required fees were already paid when they submitted their application for the CAQ that they obtained.\nInternational students who would like to extend their stay in Québec for studies beyond December 31, 2020, in order to complete a study program or to begin a new program in the fall 2020 semester, must submit a new application for a CAQ for studies to the MIFI and a new application for a study permit to the federal government. In all cases, students should start the required immigration procedures at least three months before their current authorization for studies expires.\nInternational students who have earned their degree can submit an application for permanent selection under the PEQ if they have been awarded, by an educational institution in Québec, within three years of the date of submission of their application, one of the following:\n*   a university diploma attesting to a bachelor’s, a master’s or a doctoral degree\n*   a college diploma for technical studies or a vocational diploma at the secondary level, with or without attestation of vocational specialization, obtained consecutively, attesting to 1800 hours or more of consecutive study and leading to a trade\nThe Ministère accepts attestations of successful completion of a study program as well as a final transcripts issued by the registrar of the educational institution. Since the programs admissible under the PEQ must have a minimum duration of 1800 hours, these graduates can obtain a three-year post-graduation work permit. The duration of this permit gives them all the time they need to submit an application for permanent selection under the PEQ as graduates or even as temporary foreign workers.\nThe federal government is responsible for issuing study permits.

The exceptions made for the territory of the Montréal metropolitan community also apply for the territory of the regional county municipality of Joliette.\nSecondary schools will remain closed until the end of August, following recommendations by public health authorities. Students will consolidate their distance learning through increased pedagogical support.\nAdministrative centres will continue to carry out essential activities; they therefore remain open. However, until schools reopen in their regions, administrative staff members are asked to work remotely whenever possible.\nPreschools and elementary schools are gradually resuming their activities in all regions of Québec, with the exception of schools located in the [Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal](https://cmm.qc.ca/a-propos/territoires-et-municipalites/)  (In French only) (Montréal metropolitan community, CMM), which will remain closed to students until the end of August. The exceptions made for the territory of the Montréal metropolitan community also apply for the territory of the regional county municipality of Joliette. Some secondary schools will also reopen, specifically public schools that offer regional or supraregional schooling services as well as private schools specialized in special education for students with disabilities or severe behavioral issues. Schools in the Montréal metropolitan community will reopen on May 25, health conditions permitting.\nSecondary schools will remain closed until the end of August, following recommendations by public health authorities.\nAs of May 11, students in these sectors have been able to resume their training in various ways (online courses, distance education), except for students whose schools are located in the Montréal metropolitan community and the regional county municipality of Joliette. These centres will open on May 25. Activities will resume in all training sectors.\nStaff in these sectors will also return to work, either at a distance or in person, depending on the program, while complying with physical distancing rules. Providing training at a distance or working from home should be the preferred delivery method in the current context.\nIf students must be present in person for practical training or certain evaluations, there must never be more than 15 individuals in the same space and physical distancing rules will apply.\nSince May 11, learners in this sector have been able to resume their training in various ways (online courses, distance education), except for learners whose centres are located in the Montréal metropolitan community and the regional county municipality of Joliette. These centres will open on May 25.\nAs of May 11 (May 25 for the Montréal metropolitan community and the regional county municipality of Joliette), adult education centres will be open for evaluations only. However, if students must be present in person for certain evaluations, there must never be more than 15 individuals in the same space and physical distancing rules will apply.\nThe measures put in place in the French sector will also apply in the English sector.\nIn general, elementary schools tend to be smaller than secondary schools. Secondary school students are more independent and are in a better position to finish their school year through distance learning.\nTeachers will provide pedagogical support, and sites such as [ecoleouverte.ca](https://ecoleouverte.ca/en/) , and educational activities kits will continue to be made available to elementary students, particularly those whose parents choose not to send them back to school.\nParents are not obliged to send their children back to school. Parents may decide to send them back to school after May 11, but they must give the school administration one week’s notice to allow for the organization of school transportation and pedagogical supervision in the classrooms.\nSchool organization will be based on public health recommendations, which are constantly evolving and can vary from region to region.\nEach school will take measures to respect the physical distancing recommendation of maintaining at least 2 metres between students. Where possible while following this recommendation, each group can have a maximum of 15 students.\nA variety of means can be used for groups where more than 15 students wish to return to school, such as reforming different groups of students at the same grade level, with each group staying in the same classroom until the end of the school year while respecting the 2-metre rule between individuals, for example.\nVisitors will not be allowed to enter the school.\nThe premises will be subject to regular, appropriate maintenance to ensure their cleanliness. Efforts will be made to raise awareness about proper handwashing and respiratory hygiene.\nHygiene and sanitation measures are being implemented in schools, as per public health recommendations.\nEach school will take measures to ensure that students stay the recommended 2 metres apart.\nSchool teams must carefully plan student groups according to the space they have available. It is possible that a child might not return to their usual classroom, as the groups will have to be smaller than usual.\nSchool teams must be particularly careful to set up the necessary supervision so that students remain at least 2 metres apart and wash their hands regularly. It is essential that teachers and parents collaborate in explaining these rules to the children.\nThe application of public health rules is at the heart of this return to normal life. Incidentally, 15 is the maximum number of children allowed per group, but fewer than 15 will be accepted into a group if a classroom is too small for it to respect the 2-metre physical distancing rule. Children will be assigned to a group and to a teacher, and measures will be taken to ensure that large groups of children are never in contact or together at the same time, such as having staggered recess times, with small groups of children.\nSchool organization will certainly look different. However, since the beginning of the pandemic, emergency daycare services have been set up in more than 350 elementary schools all across Québec and have managed to adapt to the new measures.\nOn the strength of the experience acquired in this context, and in collaboration with the public health authorities in each region, the school teams will ensure the safety of children and staff with care and vigilance.\nEach school will take steps to enforce physical distancing rules, thereby making sure to reduce the risk level.\nDifferent methods can be used if a group of more than 15 students wishes to return to school, such as reforming different groups of students at the same grade level, with each group staying in the same classroom until the end of the school year while respecting the 2-metre rule, for example.\nSchools will have to limit travel within the school, minimize times when groups travel at the same time and use staggered schedules.\nThey will use one room for classes, lunch and daycare. They will take turns using the schoolyard. Students must wash their hands regularly and avoid physical contact with each other.\nElementary schools are given the flexibility to adjust their schedules. For example, students could arrive and leave at different times to avoid gatherings.\nNo, wearing a mask is not compulsory. However, the government has confirmed that face coverings may be provided to teachers who request them.\nMeasures will also be taken by each educational institution to comply with the physical distancing rule of maintaining 2 metres between students.\nStudents or staff members with symptoms of COVID-19 must not enter the school. Any person who receives a diagnosis of COVID-19 must comply with a 14-day isolation period.\nNo. Like the rest of the population, students who are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms must stay at home and contact a health care professional. A [Self-Care Guide](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/self-care-guide-covid-19/) with information on the necessary steps to take has been made available to Quebecers.

However, returning to school is not recommended before September 2020 for children who are vulnerable for health reasons (chronic disease, severe immunodeficiency, etc.). Pedagogical support will be provided to these students.\nParents do not have the obligation to send their children back to school. However, as a precautionary measure, the presence at school of a child whose parents have a health vulnerability (chronic disease, severe immunodeficiency, pregnancy or person aged 70 or over) should rather be privileged from September 2020. By then, parents could opt for distance learning, with the support of members of the school staff.\nSchool attendance will remain non-compulsory until the end of the school year. Pedagogical support will be provided by teachers to all of their students, including those who do not return to the classroom. Those students will be provided with schoolwork by their teachers, who will also carry out a weekly follow-up with them.\nSince student advancement to the next grade level is determined by teachers’ professional judgment, teachers will be able to use online schoolwork or evaluations to validate their judgments of certain learning content.\nIn addition, in order to continue fostering learning by preschool, elementary and secondary students, the Ministère will continue to offer educational activities on the [Open School ](https://www.ecoleouverte.ca/en/) and on Télé-Québec. website and on Télé-Québec.\nVulnerable students are strongly encouraged to return to the classroom as soon as possible to be able to benefit from optimal pedagogical support. School staff will contact the parents to reassure them and provide appropriate support during the return to the classroom.\nThe members of the school teams will increase the weekly personalized follow-up with their students, giving priority to the most vulnerable students and using—for students who are not in the classroom—a technological tool allowing direct contact (e.g. telephone, video call).\nBeing present on the school premises is not recommended for staff members who are vulnerable for health reasons (chronic disease, severe immunodeficiency, pregnancy or aged 70 or older). For health and safety reasons, these staff members are encouraged to delay their return to school until September 2020.\nAs soon as a case is confirmed, the child is isolated in a room and cannot return to school for a period of 14 days. Schools have received an emergency kit to be used when a case of COVID-19 is confirmed.\nThe public health authority in the region concerned will assess the situation and issue appropriate instructions.\nAnyone who presents [symptoms associated with COVID-19](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/general-information-about-coronavirus/#c46469) must immediately leave the school premises, call 1-877-644-4545 and follow the instructions they are given. Pedagogical support will be provided to students during their absence from school.\nYes, school transportation will resume as soon as schools reopen, and the routes will be established based on the needs. Strict measures determined by the public health authority must be respected, including a limit of one child per bench. Every second bench must remain empty. The driver must be provided with a protective zone. In the event it is not possible to create a protective zone, drivers may wear the protective equipment provided.\nIt is recommended that parents transport their child to school until the end of the school year if they are able to do so.\nParents must inform the school as to whether they want their child to use school transportation, and the school will organize transportation based on the needs.\nIt is recommended that parents transport their child to school until the end of the school year if they are able to do so.\nStarting on May 11, as preschools and elementary schools in some regions reopen, school daycare services will resume regular operations in every school. Any family with children enrolled at a school can register for that school’s daycare services, if needed, by following the standard local procedures.\nIn the Montréal metropolitan community, emergency daycare services will remain open until the end of the school year. The exceptions made for the territory of the Montréal metropolitan community also apply for the territory of the regional county municipality of Joliette.\nAs this is a return to normal activities, students must register directly at the school where they are enrolled.\nThe main objective of the return to the classroom and of the support for students remaining at home will be to reinforce the essential learning required to move up to the next grade level.\nNo, the school year will not be extended into summer.\nStudent advancement to the next grade level will be determined by the students’ evaluations carried out before schools closed on March 13. In addition, teachers are asked to determine the students’ results for the last report card based on their knowledge of the students’ acquired learning.\nNo matter the level, schools must plan for a review period at the beginning of the 2020-2021 school year.\nAt the moment, it is difficult to predict the needs for educational staff as the number of students that will be present in schools is not yet known. However, the limitations imposed by physical distancing, that is, maintaining 2 metres between individuals, and the exclusion of employees who are vulnerable for health reasons will create added pressure on the availability of elementary school teachers. If necessary, secondary school teachers on permanent contracts will be asked to step in, with the support of professionals and support staff in elementary schools. The order allowing for this redeployment of resources must come from a reassignment measure from the local union, if necessary.\nNo. The ministerial examinations will not be administered. Students were unable to acquire all the learning targeted by the programs of study because of the health crisis that caused educational services to be suspended for a considerable amount of time.\nThe government can, if the circumstances warrant it, cancel an examination and use the marks awarded by the school as a final grade. Due to the current exceptional circumstances, the ministerial examinations will be cancelled, and the school results will be taken into account in the awarding of diplomas. Students will move up to the next grade level based on the teachers’ professional judgment and the students’ previous results on the first two report cards.\nNon-essential activities like infrastructure sharing are temporarily interrupted in order to slow the spread of the virus, as a public health measure. Related activities such as room rentals as well as sports and cultural activities are also targeted by the closure.\nA massive open [online course](https://jenseigneadistance.teluq.ca/)  (In French only) is available, free of charge, for teachers who wish to improve their understanding of how technological tools can be used to provide support.\nCollege- and university-level teaching activities will continue at a distance for the Summer 2020 term, until September, except in the case of practical training that cannot be carried out remotely and that is necessary to enable students to continue their studies in order to graduate.\nResearch activities in colleges, in the Centres collégiaux de transfert de technologie and in universities may resume. Accordingly, research activities related to the health, science, agriculture, forestry and engineering sectors, as well as vital seasonal outdoor activities, the resumption of which is urgently awaited, may now begin. The resumption of activities in all other research sectors should also be considered if these sectors are directly related to the collective effort to relaunch the economy.\nMoreover, institutions of higher education may resume any activity they deem necessary and may authorize some of their employees to return to the workplace. Whenever possible, remote work must still be the preferred approach when resuming these activities.\nAll of the above is conditional upon compliance with the guidelines issued by the competent authorities, namely the Direction de santé publique, the CNESST and the IRSST.\nIf internship settings have confirmed the continuation of the internship, the students’ workplace respects the guidelines issued by the public health authority, and the students are able to complete the internship, for example, by working remotely, then internships are possible. However, students cannot be penalized for their inability to meet requirements.\nIt is up to each institution to establish learning and evaluation procedures it deems appropriate in order to ensure that students develop the competencies required to complete their program of study and to graduate. Students should not be penalized for their inability to complete their program through alternative means developed by their institution.\n**Compiling of a list of students and materials**\nStudents may collect their personal effects once they have been invited to do so by the administration of the institution and in compliance with the hygiene measures issued by the Direction de Santé publique.\n**Access to educational institutions**\nThis is an exceptional procedure that aims to meet the most urgent needs of students, teachers and professors. The Ministère will not establish specific categories; rather, it will call upon institutions to identify the persons concerned as well as the order of priority.\nExceptionally, and for this purpose only, each institution must establish an adapted procedure that ensures compliance with physical distancing guidelines, particularly by tightly controlling the number of people who can access the institution’s premises. Anyone accessing a building on the institution’s premises must wash their hands upon entering and leaving. Students must be supervised when moving about the premises in order to minimize any risks.\nThe administration must establish a precise schedule in order to control the number of people present at any given time and to ensure that necessary services are available to students and teachers with special needs. If necessary, the administration may contact its regional public health agency to obtain further information.\nThese guidelines must be followed at all times:\n*   Handwashing is mandatory when entering a building.\n*   Physical distancing must be maintained and there must be no contact between individuals.\n*   Students cannot be accompanied by another person.\n*   Anyone experiencing flu-like symptoms must be excluded from this operation.\nAll Explore 2020 spring and summer sessions have been cancelled.\nFinancial assistance will continue to be available for students whose period of studies may be lengthened.\nFor the moment, the student financial assistance program has not been modified. Payments will continue to be issued.\nThe income taken into account when calculating the 2019-2020 financial assistance is that of the 2019 calendar year. For that reason, any fluctuations in the students’ income in 2020 are not considered for 2019-2020. In some cases, they may, however, affect the calculations for 2020-2021. The government has announced that it will be postponing repayment of any loans incurred under the Loans and Bursaries Program and the Loans Program for Part-Time Studies for a period of six months.\nThe Loans and Bursaries Program already accounts for the financial needs of people who are caring for children. Students who have lost their jobs due to the current situation may apply for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.\nThe Minister of Education and Higher Education is currently studying the best ways to increase the amount of financial assistance awarded to students in Québec and is collaborating with the federal government to ensure financing. Announcements to student associations are planned in the coming weeks to prepare for a rollout in Fall 2020.\nNo, the government has announced that repayments of all loans contracted under the Loans and Bursaries Program and the Loans for Part-Time Studies Program are postponed for a period of six months. The government will pay the interest.\nNo payments are expected during this period. You do not have to take any steps or provide any proof to benefit from this exceptional measure, since it applies automatically to anyone who has incurred a debt with Aide financière aux études.\nNo. The government will pay the interest. Students are not required to make any payments during this period.\nYes. Contact your financial institution. They will tell you what steps to follow.\nNo. The government has made arrangements with all partner financial institutions to automatically postpone the repayment plan. People who have contracted student loans do not have to take any action.\nNo. Your financial institution will automatically extend the amortization period for your loan by six months and your monthly payments will remain the same.\nYes. This measure applies to all outstanding amounts, whether owed to a financial institution or in collection with Aide financière aux études.\nFor the next six months, you will not be required to make repayments of your student loan.\nYour Deferred Payment Plan is also suspended for six months.\nAfter this postponement ends, your Deferred Payment Plan will continue for the rest of the time remaining in it.\nNo. This postponement is not included in the 60 months of eligibility for the Deferred Payment Plan.\nNo. This postponement applies only to student loans contracted under a program offered by the Aide financière aux études department of the Ministère de l’Éducation et de l’Enseignement supérieur.\nIf you have questions about lines of credit and other student loans offered by your financial institution, please contact the staff there directly.\nThe modifications to the different administrative procedures announced for educational institutions apply to both Québec and international students. It is recommended that any information that may be of interest on this page be consulted as it pertains to all students.\nInternational students will be entitled to the [Canada Emergency Response Benefit ](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/cerb-application.html) (CERB) if they meet the program eligibility criteria, particularly:\n*   Have declared an income of at least $5000, earned in Canada or outside the country, during the last fiscal year or during the 12 months prior to their application. Applicants must be Canadian residents.\n*   Have stopped working in relation to the COVID-19 crisis, without having left their employment voluntarily. Thus, they are not eligible if they stopped working before the crisis began.\nNo measure is currently planned for this specific purpose.\nThe repatriation of foreign nationals is usually the responsibility of their country of origin.\nNo measure is currently planned for this specific purpose.No measure is currently planned for this specific purpose.\nNo measure is currently planned for this specific purpose.\nHowever, the Ministère has encouraged educational institutions to offer special support and possibly implement measures to help international students who may find themselves in a precarious situation.\nInternational students will be able to leave Canada based on available flights or may choose to stay in Canada if they have yet to complete their studies, provided that their immigration documents are in order.\nInstitutions are encouraged to continue processing all applications so as to not delay the subsequent steps required for international students to begin their studies at the chosen institution.\nInternational students must have a valid Québec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ) and study permit when they begin their classes. To obtain these documents, students must have a proof of admission.\nNote that international students are not required to obtain a CAQ and a study permit prior to starting a program of study through distance education while they are not residing in Canada. However, they will need to obtain these documents before being authorized to enter the country to complete their program in person, as needed.\nInternational students can attend distance courses, just like Québec students.\nImmigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has not announced the automatic renewal of temporary residency permits. Students are asked to submit a request for renewal before the date on which their permit expires. If students meet this condition, they are granted “implied status,” meaning that their current temporary residency is maintained until a decision is made regarding their application. International students are requested not to go to border crossings in an attempt to renew their immigration documents. The most up-to-date information is usually published by the [federal government](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/coronavirus-covid19/visitors-foreign-workers-students.html) .\nThe Ministère de l’Immigration, de la Francisation et de l’Intégration (MIFI) is extending, until December 31, 2020, the minister’s consent for the duration of the stay in Québec of international students whose Québec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ) for studies expires as of April 30, 2020 and before December 31, 2020. This regulation applies to students whose CAQ had not already expired on April 30, 2020.\nTemporary residents must maintain valid temporary resident status at all times. The Ministère de l’Immigration, de la Francisation et de l’intégration (MIFI) continues to process applications for temporary selection.\nStudents who were already studying in Canada and whose courses were moved online due to the travel restrictions and public health measures introduced because of COVID-19 will not be penalized and will retain their eligibility for the PGWPP, including the length of the work permit to which they would be entitled. However, these students must continue at least 50 % of their program of study in Canada to be eligible for the PGWPP.\nThe IRCC has introduced a new temporary policy for students who currently hold a study permit or who were approved for a study permit for a program set to begin in May or June 2020, but who are unable to enter Canada due to the current travel restrictions. If courses of study are delivered online exceptionally because of COVID-19, the eligibility of these students for the Post-Graduation Work Permit Program (PGWPP) will not be affected. International students in this situation can begin their courses from outside Canada and complete up to 50% of their program from outside the country if they cannot travel to Canada earlier.\ninternational students are not required to obtain a Québec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ) and a study permit to study through distance education. However, they will need to obtain these documents before being authorized to enter the country to complete their program in person, as needed.\nIt is important to note that students whose study permits were issued no later than March 18, 2020, are exempt from the [travel restrictions in place in Canada ](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/coronavirus-covid19/visitors-foreign-workers-students.html) and are therefore allowed to enter the country. However, they must not be experiencing any symptoms prior to boarding their flight and must undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine period upon their arrival.\nFor information on health protection, foreign nationals can refer to the Questions and answers about our services during the pandemic page on the [Régie de l’assurance maladie du Québec website](https://www.ramq.gouv.qc.ca/en/regie/press-room/Pages/questions-answers-services-during-pandemic.aspx) , specifically the following sections:\n*   COVID-19: Information and screening – What coverage does Québec provide for COVID-19 screening and care? \n*   Foreign workers and students in Québec: health insurance coverage\nThe Ministère de l’Immigration, de la Francisation et de l’Intégration (MIFI) is extending, until December 31, 2020, the minister’s consent for the duration of the stay in Québec of international students whose Québec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ) for studies expires as of April 30, 2020 and before December 31, 2020. This regulation applies to students whose CAQ had not already expired on April 30, 2020.\nThis decision is intended to facilitate the steps that must be taken by inernational students who were in the process of completing their study program but who must extend their stay in Québec due to the current health state of emergency and the temporary interruption of their courses.\nThese students can therefore submit an application to the federal government as soon as possible to have their study permit extended without having to include a new CAQ, which will allow them to maintain valid temporary residence status and to complete their study program when their courses resume.\nNo, international students will not have to pay any fees for extending their CAQ, since the required fees were already paid when they submitted their application for the CAQ that they obtained.\nInternational students who would like to extend their stay in Québec for studies beyond December 31, 2020, in order to complete a study program or to begin a new program in the fall 2020 semester, must submit a new application for a CAQ for studies to the MIFI and a new application for a study permit to the federal government. In all cases, students should start the required immigration procedures at least three months before their current authorization for studies expires.\nInternational students who have earned their degree can submit an application for permanent selection under the PEQ if they have been awarded, by an educational institution in Québec, within three years of the date of submission of their application, one of the following:\n*   a university diploma attesting to a bachelor’s, a master’s or a doctoral degree\n*   a college diploma for technical studies or a vocational diploma at the secondary level, with or without attestation of vocational specialization, obtained consecutively, attesting to 1800 hours or more of consecutive study and leading to a trade\nThe Ministère accepts attestations of successful completion of a study program as well as a final transcripts issued by the registrar of the educational institution. Since the programs admissible under the PEQ must have a minimum duration of 1800 hours, these graduates can obtain a three-year post-graduation work permit. The duration of this permit gives them all the time they need to submit an application for permanent selection under the PEQ as graduates or even as temporary foreign workers.\nThe federal government is responsible for issuing study permits.
